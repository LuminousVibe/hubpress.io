<p>As I write this, my hands are shaking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I reentered FaceBook society today after taking a mental health break.  In the wake of our questionable President-Elect, I have been forced to reorganize my though processes concerning the next four years of my life.  It is no secret Mr. Trump is no fan of disabled persons and I have no doubt that extends to people of any kind of mental and physical health problems.  You can’t really expect a person who claims pregnant women are an inconvenience to employers to have any sympathy for those of us with chronic and sometimes debilitating illnesses.  It has already been hard to plan with an unpredictable disease like gastroparesis.  Now I am trying to factor in variables like cuts to public health programs, the loss of the Affordable Care Act, and rising prescription drug prices under a regime that has expressed no interest in curbing them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I saw a post today about a young girl being fitted for leg braces as a result of a disease that will likely take her life in the next 4 years.  The point of the post wasn’t “isn’t my daughter’s life sad” though.  It was “my daughter will need these public health funding programs that Republicans are threatening to cut in the very near future”.  Everyone keeps telling those dependent on such programs to just get out there and vote for a better candidate next election.  As if that were possible.  As if we had the time.  We can’t wait 4 years for a better president.  We need one now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many of my friends recently have commented on what an improvement my health has made recently.  “You got so skinny for a while.”  “We were so worried about you.”  “I’m so glad you’re better now.”  I have a secret to tell you all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My health will be short-lived.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You see, almost all of my recent gains have come as a result of a drug called Reglan.  If you don’t shudder at the sight of that name, that’s fine.  It’s marketed as a short-term solution to nausea, vomiting, GERD, and is even sometimes given to pregnant women to help with the production of breast milk.  What Reglan does is stimulate the nerves and muscles of the digestive system in order to help you digest food more efficiently and quickly.  A miracle for someone whose stomach doesn’t digest food at all on its own.  Why don’t we hand this out like candy?  Cure sufferers of chronic stomach ailments once and for all?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reglan doesn’t start causing problems until you are taking it long term.  “Long term” here means more than a few weeks.  It starts with increased anxiety and nervousness and escalates into full on Parkinson’s-like tremors and muscle movements.  An irreversible neurological disorder call Tardive Dyskinesia.  Symptoms include tremors and shaking in the extremities, facial twitching and grimacing, random movements of the limbs, and difficulty breathing.  Unmistakably linked to use of neuroleptics, antipsychotics, and drugs like Reglan.  In fact, multiple doctors have told me Reglan has an unusually high chance of producing Tardive Dyskinesia over the long term.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve been on it for over a year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For starters, I didn’t feel like starving to death at the ripe old age of 22.  But also, there exists a percentage of Reglan users for gastroparesis who never develop complications.  I spoke to someone who’s been on it for 8 years without a problem and I spoke to someone who developed symptoms the day she started taking it.  So you don’t really know.  Maybe you win the lottery or maybe this game of Russian Roulette puts a bullet in you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My point in all this is there is a very high probability of me needing to quit my miracle drug in the near future.  If I’m going to develop symptoms, I’m going to do it soon.  I’ve goon too long without side effects.  My doctors are considering taking me off before I develop symptoms to begin with.  For them, the chances of possibly irreversible damage are too high.  I still prefer not to starve to death.  But if you paid attention to my introductory post, you know what happens to me when my stomach isn’t medicated.  If you know me in real life, you got to witness years of it up close.  And my window is closing right as our loving Republican party is threatening to defund and take away the very health programs and insurance policies that will keep me alive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We don’t have 4 years and we don’t have the option of hoping Mr. Trump’s policies overlook us in the coming reign.  We are going to need help and we are going to need it soon.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And, as I write this, my hands are shaking.</p>

<p>So this is my blog.  I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time thinking about starting one, wondering what I would share, and how I would go about saying it.  Mostly, though, this exists for my sanity, and anything I write will be for the purpose of preserving my sanity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was born on November 9th of a year I will not specify.  For most of my life, I&#8217;ve been fairly normal and healthy.  Maybe I didn&#8217;t get along with everyone, and maybe I suffered some childhood traumas that needed a little therapy to work through, but I was nothing out of the ordinary.  And yes, I consider needing a little therapy at some point ordinary.  I did well in school, got accepted into the accelerated programs at all levels, took some Advanced Placement classes and eventually graduated with a respectable GPA and many college prospects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My problems began so slowly I didn&#8217;t really recognize them at first.  You see, because my parents couldn&#8217;t afford to send me to the schools I wanted to attend (something I will <strong>never</strong> blame them for), I took a year and a half off to "find myself" (essentially do whatever I wanted) before entering my local City College to get my shit together.  It took me a while to figure out my major, and I jumped from Chemistry, to Linguistics, to Foreign Languages, before settling on English Literature.  It made sense when I finally got there.  What do I love more than anything?  Reading and writing.  Why not get a degree in it?  All the while I was watching my friends essentially speed past me, get degrees, get employed, get married, etc. while I kinda&#8230;&#8203; sat.  If you asked me then, I would have said I&#8217;m going at my own pace and fuck you if you have a problem with it.  It was nice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Midway through June of 2013, I woke up nauseous.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looking back, this wasn&#8217;t the start of my anxiety disorder.  It was just the proverbial straw.  The start was that pesky trauma I mentioned, followed by not being able to go to college, followed by watching everyone around my basically live their lives without me.  It all built up into this little ball inside me that I wasn&#8217;t recognizing.  And then I woke up nauseous.  And then I stayed nauseous.  And then my doctor told me I had ulcers.  And then acid reflux.  And then a bacterial infection. And a bowel disorder. And IBS. And allergies. And then&#8230;&#8203; nothing.  I went through 12 doctors, untold tests and procedures, medications galor, side effects, and none of them helped.  I went from 160 pounds to 95 in 6 months.  I lived on rice and potatoes for a year.  They finally found a medication that stabilized me, but nothing made the nausea go away.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I gave up on the doctors and I gave up on my health and I let myself deteriorate and just continued on with school.  I developed serious perfectionism, then paranoia, germaphobia, all of which bloomed into Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depressive episodes.  My life imploded, and I let it.  I began a slow spiral into insanity and all the little things I had ignored about my life came back to haunt me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In May of 2015 I was accepted to The University of California Berkeley.  In August of 2015 I was diagnosed with Gastroparesis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gastroparesis is the weakening or total paralysis of the stomach muscles.  The symptoms are nausea, vomiting, stomach and abdominal pains, constipation, acid reflux, loss of appitite, and weight loss.  It can be caused by diabetes, cancer, botched abdominal surgeries, certain auto-immune disorders, complications of viral infections, and old age.  I had all of those symptoms and none of those causes.  I fall into the 10-15% of cases that present idiopathic.  No known cause.  No cure.  The only treatments are certain medications that can speed the emptying of the stomach, block nausea receptors in the brain, and calm the stomach acid.  And I finally got help.  Not just with my stomach, but with my anxiety and depression.  I found an answer, I found a reason to keep going, and, with the help of my now-fiancé, I found a psychiatrist.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, over a year later, I also have this.  A place to come with my struggles and anxieties.  This is not a happy story with a happy ending unfortunately.  My diagnosis brought more anxiety and stress.  Attending Cal, a top university, multiplied it.  I am in a place where I don&#8217;t know what to do or where to go from here.  There are no more answers to find, just the next treatment and the next day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I guess, while accepting the risk of sounding cheesy, I hope to help others like me.  This battle has encompassed me, body and mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And I am not alone.</p>
