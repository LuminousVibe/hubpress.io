<p>I’m having a series of those days.  If you have depression, you know those days.  They’re the I didn’t want to get out of bed, I didn’t take a shower, I don’t want to eat, I don’t want to do anything kind of days.  And I don’t want to write.  But in a strange sort of way, that gives me hope for my writing.  I don’t want to write today in the same way that I don’t want to take a shower.  But I love taking showers.  If it wouldn’t be a complete and utter waste of water I’d probably stand in one all day and just be warm and feel the water on my skin and that would be the happiest day of my life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But today, and yesterday, and the day before as well, I didn’t want to do that thing.  I didn’t want to experience my very favorite sensation.  Because of depression.  Similarly, when I used to write, I used to feel the most satisfying sensation of fulfillment and joy and power.  It was my favorite activity next to reading, and I’ve lost that over the years.  But I’ve lost it in the same way that today I’ve lost my desire to feel running water on my skin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I begin to wonder if I’ve lost it to my depression.  And if that is in fact the case, can I get it back?  For example, yesterday was the worst of this series of days.  I did nothing yesterday.  I watched Netflix and played iPad games and fiddled with my bullet journal.  But I did still force myself to write a little.  It was a short post, very short of the 1667 goal, and it was private.  But I counted it anyway because it was in the vein of my other writings thus far in NaNo and I didn’t want the day to end with nothing gained.  So despite my depression, I still wrote.  And maybe, if it’s my depression that is taking my writing from me, I can get it back.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So that is my musing on writing and why I might be losing my fire for it recently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I left this blog off telling the story of Amy, and that story is not finished.  But I can’t tell the rest of it today.  Depression and all that jazz.  And also I don’t really know where to take you next in Amy’s life.  She eventually becomes the young woman writing this and I know how she did, but telling the story to a reader is another task.  Instead, today I want to talk about something I’ve been gathering material and mental notes on for a while.  A few months ago I signed up for and began delivering for Postmates, and there are many things I want to share about the process and the app for others who are interested in the driver’s side of the story.  So here we go:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Firstly, signing up as a Postmates driver is not a thing you can just do in a day.  I mean, you can make the decision in a day, but it will be at least a week before you are able to start taking assignments.  In my case, it took two and a half weeks, but I had extenuating circumstances which I will explain in a moment.  To begin the process, you must visit the Postmates Fleet website in a browser window.  The signup process can be done on a phone, but it has to be done in a browser window and I find that easier on a computer.  The website boasts earnings of $25+ an hour, but I will tell you now I have never made that much in the months I’ve been delivering, even on my best days.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need a valid email address and a password, and I recommend using one you check often because they email you a lot and some of the emails are important.  Next you need to enter your legal first and last name and a phone number.  Your legal name has to match the one on your driver’s license, which you also need to have, because they use it to run a background check on you.  More on that in a moment.  You also need to use your personal cellphone number, on which you need to be able to download apps (both android and apple are supported) and you also need to be able to receive push notifications and text messages.  There is a drop-down menu of cities Postmates operates in which you can select from, and depending on the city your vehicle type can range from walking to bicycle to other types of motor vehicles.  You can operate in any of the cities Postmates is active in once you are cleared, this initial city should just be the one you think you’ll be in most often.  I selected Orange County and often cross into other cities and areas in my deliveries.  Most cities are only set up for drivers, so if you don’t have some kind of vehicle handy, you may be out of luck.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After going through all the steps to enter your name and driver’s license number and such, you will see a screen which will basically be the progress bar for your activation.  It will ask you to complete some basic questions about yourself, upload a profile picture, and enter your address.  Two important things here.  The picture should be of your whole face and it should be a good view of what you will look like on a day-to-day basis, because it will be shown to your customers and they need to be able to recognize you.  The address also needs to be the one you live at or are able to retrieve mail from, because Postmates will send you a branded reusable bag and a prepaid credit card to use on deliveries.  You cannot begin deliveries without the card they send you, and if you lose it you cannot do more deliveries until you order and receive a new one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here’s the part that takes time.  I got my card and bag in the mail about four days after I signed up (there’s no tracking info btw, so you just need to look out for it).  Once you receive the card you need to activate it on the Fleet website, and then they do the background check.  They don’t order the background check until you receive and activate your prepaid card.  Seems a little backward, but that’s how they do it.  The background check takes a few days and you can get a copy of what they receive if you want, no charge.  If all goes well, you’re usually done in about a week and you get to download the Fleet app onto your phone and start accepting deliveries.  Also, yes it is a different app than the Postmates app.  It is called Fleet, and you can have them text you a link to download it from the app store to make sure you get the right one.  And you sign into it using the same login info you used to create your Dashboard account, so remember that email address and password.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It took me longer to get started because the address I gave them didn’t match the one on my Driver’s License, so the background check completed fine, but for some reason there was a hold on my Fleet account.  So when I opened the app it would tell me my account hadn’t been activated yet and I needed to complete all the steps on my Fleet Dashboard in order to become active.  So I had to contact support and open a ticket and wait for them to get back to me.  Here again, the website is full of shit.  Their support site claims they will respond to your support request within 24 hours.  I’ve contacted support twice so far, and both times it took 3-4 days to get a response.  But, once they did respond they were always extremely helpful and got everything sorted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So It took about 4 extra days for my account to become active, and it was due to a glitch in their system with my addresses not matching.  So if you’ve recently moved or something like that, you may run into the same problem.  I don’t know if it’s an overall glitch or if it was just me, but they will happily fix it and get your account activated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At some point in the process, I don’t remember when, you also need to enter your bank account information.  This is so they can pay you.  If you don’t have a checking or savings account or something to that effect, I don’t know how they handle payments.  I don’t think you can use paypal or a visa card or anything.  I specifically remember putting in my routing number and account number and such.  They don’t ask for anything that you can’t get off a check for that account and I did extensive research into it before putting in my info.  So as far as I know, it’s super secure and the only thing they use it for is direct deposits of your earnings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So here you are, prepaid card activated, background check passed, app downloaded, ready to go online.  I’m going to walk you through the bones of a typical delivery, then go into details about each of the steps, then give my general tips for new drivers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So this is what happens:  You open the app and press the small green box that says “Go Online”.  It will have already locked onto your location, and will start searching for deliveries in your vicinity.  You can close the app at this point, it will keep searching for deliveries in the background.  Once it matches you with one you will get a notification that a new delivery is available.  Once you open the app and hit Accept, it will show you your pickup location and the order details.  The Fleet app shows you a map, but it doesn’t give you directions.  You have to tap a green square next to the delivery location and it will ask you to choose from whatever maps apps you have on your phone (mine shows Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze).  It will automatically enter the destination in the app you choose and off you go.  Once you arrive you need to check the order to make sure you get the correct items, then enter back into the Fleet app and complete the pick up.  Then it will show you the customer’s drop off location.  Go through the same map selection process (you must make this selection every time by the way) and make your way to the customer’s location.  Once you have given the delivery to the customer, you have to go back into the Fleet app and complete the delivery.  Do not do this until you have handed the customer the items.  Once you complete the delivery, the app will revert to the map view and a small notification will pop up telling you what your delivery fee is before tip.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, as it happens, most deliveries are more complicated than this depending on the restaurant or shopping location and and how they are set up with Postmates.  About three quarters of my deliveries are food orders from restaurants, and the remaining quarter is split between other food items (like ice cream or boba drinks) or grocery stores or 7-11s to pick up something else.  You can order almost anything from any store on Postmates, but most people use it for food of some type.  There are some restricted items like alcohol and tobacco products that a Fleet driver is not allowed to pick up.  There is a list in the FAQ of the Fleet app and on the Postmates website.  If you get an order with something like that in it you’re supposed to immediately report the order to support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, the first complication you will run into with delivering is accepting orders.  I often start out at my local Starbucks because I like to pick up a drink to sip on while I’m delivering.  There isn’t enough time between deliveries to pick up food or drinks unless you go offline for a bit to do it, so starting by getting those things or packing a snack or something is a good idea.  So I usually get my drink and hang out in the parking lot until the app matches me with a delivery.  It matches you based on how close you are to the pickup location, and my area is fairly busy, so it doesn’t usually take long to get my first delivery.  If you’re in a less busy area, you might drive toward a more commercial location like a shopping center or some place with a lot of food locations.  It should match you quickly from there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the point that you go online, the Fleet app will be constantly running in the background of your phone, both searching for nearby deliveries and keeping track of your location.  If you are out on a delivery and a new one comes up that you would be close to, it will send you a notification no matter what you’re doing.  If you’re driving, if you’re picking up an order, whatever.  So, if you are not good at handling your phone while driving, I suggest you practice taking short glances at it while driving.  You don’t need to be able to text and drive or anything, and that is illegal anyway, but you need to be able to click the new delivery notification, you need to be able to accept the new delivery, and you need to be able to go back into your maps app if you are currently on a delivery.  Unfortunately, you will probably have to do this while driving a lot.  The new delivery notifications are timed, and if you don’t accept the delivery in time, Fleet assigns it to a new driver.  The timer is about 30 seconds from receipt of the notification.  I like to use a navigation app that still gives directions while you are in another app for this reason.  You have to go into the Fleet app to accept the new delivery, and the Google Maps app continues to give directions while in other apps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fleet will only give you two deliveries at one time, for a total of 4 stops.  If you accept a new delivery while already on one, the app will take you through the delivery steps as normal.  For example, you can’t pick up both deliveries and then go to the drop off locations.  You have to pick up one delivery, deliver it, and then pick up the next one and deliver it.  On busy days, I will go from delivery to delivery without a break between.  That is to say, my next delivery will be assigned and accepted usually while I am on the delivery leg of my previous assignment.  So, like I said above, not a lot of time between deliveries unless it’s a slower day.  Even on slow days, there’s only a few minutes after I complete a delivery and a new delivery is assigned.  My area is really busy, it may be different in less populated areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next thing you’ll run into is actually picking up the orders.  There’s a whole list of things that can happen at the pickup location, and the Fleet app will tell you exactly what you need to do once you get there when you accept the delivery.  Some orders are pre-sent to the restaurant and prepaid for, so all you have to do is ask for it by name or order number.  Sometimes you’ll have to pay using your prepaid card, and in those cases you have to take a picture of the receipt and type in the total dollar amount before the app will allow you to complete the order.  Sometimes you will have to order the food once you get to the restaurant, pay with your card, and wait for it to be prepared before you can leave.  If it’s a special thing like groceries or a gas station visit, you’ll have to walk through the store and find the items and pay.  Any of these options can come up at the pickup location.  When you use the prepaid card you have to use it as credit, not debit, and you are not allowed to leave a tip at restaurants that have the option.  It kinda sucks for that restaurant, but you are super not allowed to leave a tip using the prepaid Postmates card.  Also, going back to restricted items.  A driver really really can’t pick up alcohol or tobacco or any other list of things.  When you get an order that may contain one of these items, Postmates actually texts you with the list so you don’t forget.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next fun part is actually delivering the items.  Firstly, the “insulated” bag Postmates sends you is shit at keeping things warm or cold.  I have a Trader Joe’s insulated bag that I use if I think it’s going to be a problem.  What the Postmates bag is good for though is keeping your order from spilling all over the place in your car.  Chick-Fil-A comes to mind in this instance.  Their bags are tall and skinny and they will spill everywhere in your car unless you contain them.  The Postmates bag is good for that.  It is also good for large orders which you can’t carry all yourself.  I always take it into the store with me incase the order is too big.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Actually getting to the customer is also another issue.  Many of mine live in gated communities or apartment complexes or other things like that.  About half of them will leave instructions in the app about getting to them.  Sometimes there is guest parking, sometimes there’s a gate guard to let you in if they didn’t give you the code, sometimes the customer will meet you outside, and sometimes not.  If you can’t figure out how to get to them, there is an option to contact the customer.  Sometimes they’re helpful and sometimes they’re not.  Honestly, this is an issue I don’t have a lot of advice on.  Don’t be afraid to contact the customer if you’re having trouble, but also don’t expect all of them to be helpful.  Sometimes they’re super understanding and sometimes they aren’t.  But like I said, do not press the delivered to customer button until the items are in their hands.  You cannot contact them or support about the delivery once it’s completed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your delivery fee is calculated based on how far you had to drive to your pickup location, how long you had to wait there, and then how far you had to drive to drop off.  The minimum fee is $4.  The most I’ve gotten was $11.  And that is pre-tip.  The tip will not show up in your app until 24 hours after the delivery.  It’s their general processing time.  It may take longer depending on the customer’s credit card or bank or whatever.  In my experience, about half of people tip, so don’t be offended if they don’t.  It’s not you.  After five days, Postmates will begin the deposit process into your account.  Depending on your bank, it may take an extra day to show up in your account.  And if the process starts on a weekend, you won’t get your money until the next business day.  So this isn’t a quick way to get money.  If all goes well, from sign up to first deposit, you will receive your first payment in about two weeks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other general tips I have:  Have some way to charge your phone while you’re driving.  The Fleet app runs constantly in the background of your phone.  It will drain your battery very insanely quickly.  Something that plugs into your car works best.  Second, have a hands-free setup for your phone in your car.  I have a Popsocket on my phone and a Popsocket clip in my car.  This setup requires the ability to stick something to your phone and a flat surface in your car to stick another thing to, and costs $20.  It works fabulously for me.  There are also numerous other options for car/phone use like cupholder arms, lighter plugs, and other brands of stick on holders.  I don’t recommend the ones that clip onto your AC vents as those can actually damage your car.  But whatever your choice, a hands-free phone holder is absolutely necessary.  Third, having something to do is nice but not required.  Audio book, good music, podcast, whatever.  Something to listen to is good.  Fourth, the Blitz notifications the app sends you are almost always BS.  In my experience, the best times to go out on weekdays are 10am-2pm, and then 4pm-whenever you stop getting notifications for dinner deliveries.  Any time on the weekend is by far the most busy and lucrative though.  Sometimes you’ll get blitz pricing and sometimes you won’t.  Even if you do, it’s not much of a boost.  Fifth, keep track of how much gas is costing you.  If you don’t have a vehicle with good milage, Postmates may not be worth your time.  About a third of my income would go to gas if Skoddie didn’t help me out with it every so often.  Sixth, figure out how you’re going to handle this income when you file for taxes.  If you make more than $600 they give you a tax form and you have to file, but I’ve been told you don’t owe until you make more than $2,000.  I don’t know how it works though.  Fleet does not withhold for taxes though, so do your research, keep track of what you’re making, and don’t forget Postmates earnings when you do your taxes.  Finally, don’t be afraid to use the support options and the customer contact options.  If there is a problem with the order when you pick it up or delivering or anything, there are ways to fix it.  The customer can also contact you, so if you get a phone call or text from a strange number on a delivery it’s probably them.  Don’t be shy, just say you&#8217;re with Postmates and give them the issue straight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overall, I just wanted to write this for people who may use the Postmates app and not realize what the drivers are doing.  I see a lot online blame going to the drivers for things we don’t actually have control over.  For example, I see a lot of people saying they don’t tip because the delivery time is so long.  But if I’m on another delivery when I get your assignment, I can’t actually speed up my current delivery to get to your faster.  Another thing is people getting frustrated when drivers don’t deliver to their door.  I understand this frustration if it’s a house in a quiet neighborhood, but if my customer lives in a closed off apartment complex with no doorman or way for me to get in without being let in, and no one lets me in, I can’t deliver to your door.  I can’t walk through walls.  Also, we have no control over what you see on the Postmates app when you make a delivery.  So any notifications or weirdness with that is not your driver’s doing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I don’t know, that’s it.  It’s generally been a positive experience for me, and most customers are just happy to get their food and move on with their day.  This is just a little insight into my struggles.  So be nice to your delivery drivers.  We’re working hard.</p>

<p>Today is a day that makes me question myself and my purpose.  Today is a day I do not want to write.  Not only because the things I am going to write about are hard for me to remember, but also because there are other things I want to do.  I want to watch YouTube and Netflix and curl in bed with my bullet journal and contemplate improvements to my life.  Or better perhaps, log onto Postmates and run some deliveries.  Make some money.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But I started a story yesterday and I didn’t tell all of it, and I think there are some important things that I left out that deserve to be told.  If I were telling that story with the intention of telling you about me, there is more to the story the editor would want.  And I admit to fatigue at the end of yesterday’s post, so I didn’t finish Amy’s story with the gusto that I started it and I don’t know if I can do that today.  But I accepted this challenge and I started telling this story, so I should tell all of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And maybe I’ll even forgive myself at the end.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will begin where little blonde Amy with the curly pigtails died.  Not at the age of ten, when the fragile thing in her heart broke and unleashed the pain she had been hiding for years.  Not even the first time she fought back; tears streaming down her face, fists clenched white with rage, voice cracking with emotion and exertion and sobs.  She fought back.  But even after those things, I believe Amy could have been saved.  She was hurt and broken, but broken things can be mended, and she had a soul sister who would have helped had she known to ask.  I do believe that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Parts of this story will remain shrouded in the veils of the past.  I can only half tell it, and in doing so I do a disservice to Amy’s memory.  She deserves the whole truth told, and I have often wondered why I don’t tell it.  But for today; nothing happens in a vacuum, and Amy’s life was no different.  She was besieged at school by those who knew nothing of her.  She was besieged after school, when she attended a daycare center full of children who knew her strangeness.  She was besieged at home, though her parents did their best to mitigate the damage there.  Her brothers had reached the age where it was no longer cool or good to be friends with their sister and so they poked at her where her parents couldn’t see.  And little broken Amy at the age of eleven entered middle school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was in this environment that a man entered her life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I will call him a man and refuse to refer to him otherwise, though he was only sixteen at the time.  He was old enough, and he knew what he did was wrong.  And he was a man in Amy’s eyes anyway, five years her senior.  I don’t remember when he started, but he started slowly and slyly.  This is how I know he knew he was wrong.  He waited until she was alone, or until his movements would go unnoticed, and he began to show her attention.  He began to smile at her, he began to stare at her, he began to touch her.  Not anywhere inappropriate of course, for that would be noticed.  But he began slowly and he escalated slowly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And this is how Amy died.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bit by bit, moment by moment.  One day, he brushed past her as she sat alone.  Innocent enough, until she thought about what had touched her in the brush.  But it was an accident.  Boys will be boys after all.  It wasn’t his fault he was firm in her proximity.  She said nothing then.  Next, she began to feel his eyes follow her as she moved.  Staring as she entered a room, staring while she chose a book, staring while she did her homework, staring staring staring.  Surely she was imagining it, but every time she looked up he had to look away.  And she said nothing then.  Next, a touch at the back of her neck as she bent over a table, but when she turned he was in conversation and no one had seen anything.  Next, another brush, knocking her books to the floor as she worked.  Next, the softest caress down the back of her neck, and gone again when she turned to look.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She said something then while the child in her quaked.  I don’t like him, she said.  He makes me uncomfortable.  But her voice was swallowed in the noise of the moment and by the words harmless and imagination and sensitive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He became bolder then.  One day he plucked a book from her hands and held it to his chest.  He wanted to see what she was reading, but his eyes weren’t on the cover and she had lost her page.  One day he grabbed her curly wild hair and twitched it in her face.  It looked so nice, he wanted a feel.  He laughed when she pulled out of his reach.  One day he laid his hand on her waist.  The briefest contact, a silky apology.  She was in his way, he needed to pass.  There was plenty of room.  One day a message appeared on her computer screen while she played a game with her friends.  He wanted to play too.  I can see you online.  She had never given him her screen name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She turned twelve in this time, and her female body began its changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And she spoke again, alone and afraid, and again she was swallowed by sensitive and imagination and emotional and there was nothing wrong and everything wrong and she shrank and shrank until she thought he’d never see her again and even then even then it continued.  She dreaded his face and his hands and his name and his laughter.  Every time he was there she waited for his hands and his voice sliding over her like a sludge she couldn’t wash off and her cries fell on deaf ears unless they wanted to torment her some more.  She stopped playing games on the internet so he couldn’t see her presence, she stopped working alone, she stopped everything and even then he found ways.  He became bolder and touched her arm but when she cried out they shushed her and looked away and when she left they berated her back.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even then even then she could have been saved she just needed someone to look but instead they lashed out and she was emotional and young and she lashed back and they looked away always away and he was a man and dangerous and a child and innocent and he came closer and no one saw for months upon months of touching and smiling and whispers and caresses no one looked when she cried no one looked when she ran and she burned with rage and fear and spite and he came closer and closer and then and then he griped her leg and smiled with all his teeth and even then they saw and did not see and then she hid and cried and then and then and then…</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then he found her alone and then his iron arm swept around her and she screamed and screamed and no one came and he whispered and shushed and tried to calm her and she screamed and he dragged through her clothing like paper and still he smiled with all his teeth and she kicked and bit and screamed a scream of rage and pain and sorrow and fear and finally her bars were opened and she ran crying all the way and would have kept running had there been road enough to run.  And when she collapsed and confessed all there was to confess there was a fire and a storm and a howling of fury and it swept around her and torn at her skin and little Amy cried in the eye of it and welcomed its rage and fed its fury and told it all there was to tell and it burned hotter at the telling and wilder at her tears.  And when the storm passed he was gone gone forever and even then even then Amy could have been saved.  Even then she was tired and broken and hurt but her hands reached out and she could have been saved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don’t believe you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cuts deeper than the sharpest knife.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And that was the day Amy died.</p>

<p>Today I’m going to tell you a story.  It is a story I haven’t told many people.  Some of you were there for some of it, one of you was there for all of it, some of you have probably put together the pieces from things I’ve said in the past.  It is not the whole story, but it is a large portion of it.  And I will tell it to you without any expectation of forgiveness, understanding, or sympathy for the things I have done and the things I have yet to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today I will tell you the story of Amy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine, if you will, a young child.  4 years old.  She is tall and skinny for her age, blessed with hair blonde as the sun is yellow and wild as the wind, eyes as blue as the sky, and a bright red birthmark splashed across the left side of her face.  The mark will shrink with age, the hair will darken, and the eyes will dim, but for now picture her as she was 20 years ago.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember her with a smile across her face, baby teeth still firmly in place, skipping across the street to her first day of kindergarten holding her mother’s hand.  Her navy blue jumper falls to her knees, covered in white tights, and buckles around the collar of her white blouse.  Her wildly curly hair is pulled into pigtails as Amy never had the patience to sit still long enough for her mother to do much more with it.  They will be gone by the end of the day, not because Amy doesn’t like them, but because she can’t help losing her hair things.  This is her favorite outfit.  She went to many stores with her mother looking for the perfect navy blue dress to wear with the perfect white blouse to her first day of school.  Her mother probably smiles as she walks alongside her skipping daughter, dressed in her best office dress as she goes to work after Amy passes through the gates of the school.  On mom’s other side walks Amy’s older brother, wispy as smoke in my memory because he is 4 year older and was not in focus on this day.  This day was for the sun and the trees lining the school’s block and the cars pulling up to drop off children and the other kindergartners playing in their own fenced off playground.  It is for Amy’s white shoes flashing in the sun as she skipped, and for the hem of her dress swinging estatically, and for the pencil box and crayons jingling happily in Amy’s backpack.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She is starting school a year before she is supposed to, at age 4, because her parents signed some special paperwork saying she is prepared and waiving rights to complain if she falls behind due to her age.  Her birthday is in November, three months into the school year, and waiting another year for three months was unbearable to her.  She already knows her letters and numbers after all, and she reads books to her mother and young brother at night at bedtime, and she watches the kids gather in the schoolyard and wonders what they are learning there and she asks and asks her mom when it would be her turn, and this year it is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a famous family story about this Amy.  She sits at the dining room table with her How to Form Letters book and her favorite storytime book open next to it.  She is going back and forth between them and a piece of paper in front of her, carefully forming letters into words into a story about a fox who becomes friends with a dog.  But Amy doesn’t know the niceties of storytelling this young, and her story contains no drama or sadness.  There is sunshine and friendship and the fox and the dog remain friends for as long as they both live.  And Amy has become a writer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kindergarten passes as it does for any young child and Amy doesn’t begin to understand life until she enters the rest of the school.  Her kindergarten classes were in their own separate yard and building, and the younger children didn’t interact with the rest of the school.  Amy’s first interaction with the real world occurs when she is five years old and she is walking back to her classroom after recess.  Some older children spot her and begin pointing and laughing.  She doesn’t understand why, and stops walking to stare at them in confusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Did you make your daddy mad or something?”  One of them finally asks.  She shakes her head in confusion.  Her daddy loves her, he never gets mad at her.  “So, what’s with your face, freak?”  She doesn’t understand the question and walks away while they point and laugh some more.  Their words echo in her head until she asks her mother about it at dinner.  The boys at school were mean today.  Was there something wrong with her face?  Her mother explains that some people don’t like it when others look different.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This explanation does little to prepare Amy for the truth of the matter.  As first grade progresses, more and more kids notice Amy, and they notice Amy’s face.  At first they ask strange questions and say mean things, and then they begin to band together to snicker and laugh when she walks by, and then they push her down and run away laughing before the teachers can see them.  And everyday Amy goes home and cries and everyday her mother tells her people don’t like it when you are different and by age six Amy understands that she is different and different isn’t a good thing to be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As elementary school progresses, the comments and the laughter and the hurt continues.  First Amy is a freak with a red mark and she has big ears.  Then the words get inside and she becomes emotional, so she is a cry baby.  Then a teacher asks why she isn’t playing with the other kids at recess and she tells her, and she is a tattle-tale.  Then she finally makes a friend, but the damage is done, and this friendship proves Amy is a freak because no one else likes her.  Then her friend begins telling the other kids things about Amy, and they have more to make fun of her for.  And this is Amy’s first introduction to betrayal, and she is seven years old, and her friend is laughing with everyone else because she has a mark on her face and big ears and she doesn’t wash her hair every day and she’s too smart and she’s too tall and she’s such a freak.  Her mother tells her to ignore them to make them go away and Amy lays on her bed with her books and cries when she gets home and no amount of ignoring them makes them stop.  The little blonde girl with pigtails and tights becomes a quiet fifth grader who spends all her time in the library.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And one day, as a group of kids pass by the library and snicker and point at her, something very small and fragile, something that’s been worn and worn by all the passing glances and the comments and the pushing and the laughter, something inside Amy’s ten year old heart breaks.  And instead of reading her book and crying, Amy turns and screams at them.  The first time it is just an inhuman noise of rage and pain that sends the laughing faces running.  Then she transforms her pain into words of her own.  She has spent years reading her books and listening to their insults and hearing their gossip and she knows now what hurts people in their hearts and she uses it all.  Because behind her quietly crying exterior, Amy was smart.  She was smarter than most of them, too smart for her own good, a good listener, a good learner, well-read, well-versed in pain, and truly tired of it all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Amy entered into middle school, sixth grade, burning with rage and hurt and many of her tormentors came with her and started anew, thinking they would continue on tormenting her in this new school with new people to help.  But that fragile thing deep down in her had broken and she was ready for them when they came for her.  The first girl came alone and went away in tears.  Amy knew too many of her weaknesses and they weren’t used to her putting up a fight.  The next attempts went down as the first.  They asked if her face changed colors with the seasons and she asked if their parents’ divorce had gone through yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem always was that Amy was too smart.  She was quiet in class while students gossiped freely about who had a crush on who.  She knew which classmates were vulnerable, she knew who was cutting, she knew who was afraid of the dark, she knew who was in the closet, who was failing math.  She knew too much and they never knew how.  But every time they came for her she came back harder.  She began to take pleasure in sending her tormentors away in tears.  She knew what to say when.  She began seeking them out when they finally left her alone.  She crafted her barbs carefully, delivered them spitefully, and took pleasure in the aftermath.  The entire class eventually learned to leave her well enough alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She was so smart, and at the same time she was so very blind.  And so very broken.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ninth grade saw a new school and mostly new classmates, but Amy’s reputation followed her.  She was a freak still, with a red stain across her face, and a bitch with a taste for blood.  Her only redeeming qualities were that she never harmed where harm had not first been done, and she never harmed physically.  But she would tell you herself that the worst damage was done with words.  Bruises fade, words take root.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All this time Amy continued to read and write and create.  She picked up books her classmates would never see and drank their lessons like water.  She honed her skills, she lived on pain, she picked her battles, and the students at this new school soon learned she had bite.  At the same time, life was going on around her.  She was growing older, hormones were going to work, and she was becoming a teenager.  And she was becoming lonely.  She had built herself a tower, given very few people the key, and then realized what keeps others locked out also keeps her locked in.  And as her reputation spread, very few people came knocking.  So very quick when it came to pain, but so very slow when it came to friendship.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And so very lonely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She crumbled inward in the way a building collapses without the proper supports.  She looked at her handiwork and her bloodshed and she wondered at what she had turned into.  She wondered if there was time to change and she wondered if there was anything worth saving even if she did.  She became truly quiet then.  Spoke softly when spoken to, lashed out when pushed, berated herself later, crumbled inward, and the cycle started again.  She didn’t know how to interact with her peers and even if she learned, it didn’t seem like they wanted to interact with her.  She began to think about ending it all then, at the ripe and horrible age of fourteen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I remember her pain vividly, and I remember her thoughts and reasons.  I remember hot tears running down her face and days at school spent in a blur of sound and color and no emotion.  It was a different pain.  It was a different yearning.  It was a life lived in sorrow and rage and pain, and it was time for it to stop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But someone wouldn’t let her stop it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And so she instead began to change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I can’t tell you the end of Amy’s story, because it continues on.  But I can tell you the story of Amy; small and blonde, enthusiastic and happy.  She existed once and now she is gone.  She is a shadowy memory in the back of my mind, joyful and kind.  She represents the best of me, and she became the worst.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here lies Amy, beaten by the ways of the world and her own frail heart.  Easy may she rest.</p>

<p>So NaNoWriMo.  Also known as National Novel Writing Month, NaNo is a challenge accepted by writers and aspiring authors every year to write 50,000 words solely within the month of November.  If you do it, you “win” and gain bragging rights and a bumper sticker or something.  I’m not really sure.  Your icon on the NaNo website gets a little crown over it or something.  I’ve clearly never won, so I don’t actually know what happens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, technically, those words are supposed to be aimed at making a novel or story or narrative of some sort, but I’ve met people who do all kinds of things with their 50,000.  A couple of friends on LiveJournal co-wrote a very entertaining fanfiction a few years ago.  Vampires, Fae, death, fire, all kinds of things.  It was a great story, but novel it was not.  I’m sure if they had taken out the copyrighted material and renamed some of the characters, they could have published it as a novel.  But they chose not to, and the masterpiece exists on LJ to this day unless the Russian mafia have deleted it for the crime of containing gayness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You know how Russians are nowadays with the gayness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So anyway, the goal is basically to write something like 1,667 words in a day every day for the thirty days of November, which adds up to 50,010 words on November 30th.  Something vaguely literary is prefered, but the operators of the challenge don’t actually police what you’re writing every day.  For example, instead of writing this post, I could really just sit here and type “blah blah blah” 1,667 times and enter it into their word counter and get my points for the day.  No one but me would know.  I don’t know why someone would do that as you don’t actually win anything, but you could do that.  Instead, I’ve decided to adapt the challenge and write a blog post for each of those days.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I got the idea from a thing YouTuber personalities do called Vlogoween and Vlogmass.  Vlogoween occurs during October, and the goal is to post a video, vlog, or similar channel content every day for the month of October.  Vlogmass is the same idea, just in December.  Some content creators do one or the other depending on which holiday they’re most excited about, some do both, and so do neither.  The only real difference is there’s no word or minute count goal for the creator to hit.  They just need to make some form of content every day for a month.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We passed 400 words in that paragraph by the way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So taking the ideas behind Vlogmass and Vlogoween, why can’t I write a blog post everyday?  Well firstly, I’m not sure I want to sit here and write 1,667 words a day.  And just thinking about it right now, there are a few days standing out in my head that I know I won’t be able to write at all, so really I need to do more than 1,667 to make up for those days.  I won’t be able to write on Sunday for example, unless I take my ipad on a Postmates journey and dictate a blog post to it full of the expletives I yell at my fellow drivers and pleasantries exchanged with customers.  I also probably won’t be able to write on Thanksgiving, because, you know, family stuff will be happening.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So there’s 3,334 words right there that I’m going to have to make up for during the other twenty eight days of the month that I’m writing.  If I write.  As we have examined in this blog, I also suffer from mental illness and gastroparesis, and some days I’m not going to want to write.  I’m going to want to jump off a cliff, or sit in my car and cry, or lay in bed and nap.  Who’s writing my 1,667 words those days?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other conundrum I face is examining the reason I write to begin with.  If I’m not writing for a novel, why am I writing 50,010 words in November?  I suppose I can make this blog into a sort of personal novel.  I can tell stories from my past, I can talk about my day, I can get up close and personal on some issues I have issues with.  But that wouldn’t make a novel.  Really, if anything, this experiment is going to be a random series of rambling blabberings I come up with every day out of the desperation of needing to string many words together in a short amount of time.  If the experiment happens at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am sick after all and I don’t know how long I’m going to be sick.  Sitting at my computer all day writing is bad for colds.  Also, Writing is hard.  Take a moment to stare in awe at the understatement of that sentence.  “Writing is hard,” says the English major.  And yet, I used to write for fun.  I used to for shits and giggles and fanfiction string together my words and publish them unto the internet and sometimes people would even read them and some of those people even enjoyed them.  Writing used to be fun.  Hard, yes.  But very fun.  Stress relieving.  I used to throw multiple pages down in a night because I realized I hadn’t updated my current story in a while and I felt bad for the people who were reading and waiting for updates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The difference between me and the YouTube peoples who celebrate Vlogmass and Vlogoween is that they aren’t completely burned out on their chosen medium.  They love vlogging and content creating and they love it so much they fling themselves into these challenges to do it every day for a month for no reward whatsoever.  I look at that type of time commitment and thought process and I question myself.  Do I want to write that much all day every day for a month?  And at the same time, if I don’t what business do I have calling myself a writer at all?  I’m sitting here applying for jobs that would require such writing from me for much longer than a month.  More writing even.  I’m sure the average technical writer or copywriter gets in more than 1,667 words in an eight hour day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’re up to 1071 words by the way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the question becomes am I still a writer?  Do I still love to write?  Do I still even want to write?  And in order to answer that question, I have decided to perhaps undertake this challenge.  To write 50,010 words in one month.  Surely an aspiring novelist, copywriter, editor, whatever can achieve such a feat.  If not, maybe writing isn’t for me after all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Or maybe I go back to the shadowy corners of the internet with my writing and write bad gay porn about my favorite fiction characters.  Because at the end of the day, that’s what started me writing in the first place.  A terribly written story about Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley in a passionate love affair behind the backs of all of her brothers, written when I was about twelve, had no idea what love even was, and hadn’t read the sixth book yet.  In my defense, it wasn’t out yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But twelve year old me had a passion for what she did in the darkness of her room where no one but she and her characters dared tread.  She had a laptop and a dream, a hero to look up to, a life to look forward to.  Did I break her along the way?  I’m not sure she exists anymore in the smoky ruins of my memory.  I can’t call her up anymore, I can’t tap into her love affair with the written word.  But I see her in my mind’s eye anyway, hunched over a keyboard as I am right now.  Smaller, happier, and less afraid, and oh so passionate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where did her passion go and can I reclaim it?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Part of this challenge is discovering myself as I am now.  Do I want to write for a living?  Do I even want to write anymore?  Was it just a passing phase I went through at the loneliest time in my life, when no one would hear me but thousands read my words with fervour and anger and love and tears?  I inspired those emotions once.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1423 words now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I wonder some days if I’m walking down the wrong path, and I guess now is the time to figure out if I am or not.  I can take a break from applying for writing jobs and look to other outlets.  I have other skills.  And sometimes you just need to pay the bills and worry about passion and meaning later.  Maybe my shadowy love affair with the English language should remain in the shadows.  We can visit for a time and make beautiful moments and free them into the void as if we gave a damn and maybe someday someone will see us and smile or grimace or cry or laugh.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So this month is the month I decide if I am a writer for now until the next time I question my existence.  I face down NaNoWriMo with all the adjectives in the world in my heart and maybe I can find that little twelve year old girl in me again.  Because she would have looked at this challenge and laughed in its face and proclaimed her poetry from the mountaintops and the cliffs of the beach and the seagulls would laugh at her and the runners passing by would wonder why there was a strange child screaming at the ocean, but to her it would be a fortress and a quest and a laughable challenge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And at the end of it she would go about her day with the smug knowledge that she was a writer through and through.  She would have slain Harry Potter himself for the joy of it and the sorrow because she knew he would be back the next day to fight fire with fire.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And that’s really all I want at the end of the day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I just</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Want</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To know&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So Day 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That was three words right there.  Look at how good I am at this.</p>
</div>

<p>I looked at my face today.  I looked at it a lot.  I looked at it before I got into the shower, I looked at it as it was rubbing on moisturizer and makeup, I took selfies and checked my makeup in a mirror after eating, and I looked in the car on the way home.  I really really looked at my face today.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve heard all the usual comments about my face from others.  Your eyes are pretty, you look nice today, why don’t you smile more, that’s a good lipstick on you, you should smile more, you have acne, why is your eye red, please smile for me, you don’t look happy, why can’t you just be happy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve been thinking about those comments a lot recently.  Yes, I like my eyes, and sometimes I wear weird lipstick colors, but I’ve always kinda considered my face to be a normal enough face.  Nose is a little big, but not funny looking, blue eyes that aren’t particularly pretty, no cheekbones to speak of, mouth on the full side of normal. If I was a Sim, I’d be the Sim you tweak to your desires, not the one you completely re-roll. Not a remarkable face.  But, for some reason, people feel the need to remark on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s not a gentle way to put it.  Basically, my face doesn’t look happy.  I have Resting Bitch Face.  I don’t smile enough.  When I do smile, it doesn’t seem like I mean it.  I wear makeup that exaggerates this sometimes, subconsciously or not.  I don’t know anymore, but I’ve heard the comments enough to have internalized them and know them as part of my character.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If I think about my face.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But usually, I don’t really think about my face.  I wash it, I put moisturizer on it, and I go about my day.  Today, I thought about it a little more by adding eyeliner, mascara, lip liner, and lipstick over it.  So every time I looked at my face today, I thought about the extra effort I put into it, and I thought about being happy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well-meaning people, usually my mother, have taken my happiness into their personal consideration recently.  And most of them have correctly come to the conclusion that I am not happy.  And they have incorrectly used my face as proof that I am not happy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rather than my words or actions or any and all knowledge of my life the past few years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These well-meaning people, and my mother, with often times take to trying to get me to smile for them.  Not in a condescending way or in that gross hey-baby-why-don’t-you-smile-for-me guy hanging out of a truck window way.  Just in a gentle cajoling sort of way.  Sometimes in an attempted trick way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hey!  Smile!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because an involuntary smile will somehow prove that the unhappiness was all a ruse, that I was just waiting for someone to tell me there was a storm-cloud over my head before I realized I needed an umbrella.  And I’m not singling out my mother because she is not well-meaning, I’m singling her out because she is the most common perpetrator of these shenanigans.  And, arguably, she is the most well-meaning.  She desperately wants me to be happy, so much so that she assaults me in the fruit aisle and demands that I smile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because people who smile all the time are happy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I tried it today.  I molded my face to “look happy”.  I don’t mean by just smiling, I mean I stood in front of a mirror and moved my skin around to try to arrange my face into a happy expression.  What would my face look like if it was just naturally happy?  My cheeks would have to be hollowed to start.  The attractive rounded quality they’ve acquired during my recovery also weighs down the corners of my mouth.  The outer corners of my eyes would have to come up to make me look more awake.  They are also weighed down by skin under my eyes, which seems to have become heavier as the years pass.  I noticed then the dark circles many complain about as well.  Those will have to go.  Tired people aren’t happy. Or is it happy people aren’t tired?  The eyebrows need to “unfurrow” or come apart and the lines between them need to go.  I could probably pluck them into a more attractive shape.  Cover the dark circles with makeup, maybe use a different eye lining technique to make them look wider and more awake.  If all else fails, get some plastic surgery to lift those outer corners.  I would do that while I’m in there getting my cheeks thinned out after losing weight to hollow out my face fails to bring the corners of my lips up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Did you catch on to the problem yet?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don’t look unhappy because I am unhappy.  Conversely, I am not unhappy because I look unhappy.  My face is just like that.  I could be the happiest or unhappiest person in the world, but I don’t constantly work my face into a smile so people assume the latter.  And I mean, I’m not going to deny that I am unhappy with my life currently.  But my face doesn’t look like it does because I am unhappy.  My face just formed that way.  I’m not sorry for it.  And I’m probably not going to smile, even if you yell it really loudly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So that brings me back around to thinking about my face and why people, especially my mom and especially recently, feel the need to comment on the fact that it looks unhappy.  And what happiness has to do with my face anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Earlier I mentioned my mother desperately wants me to be happy.  She talks about it every time I see her.  And I’ve argued she is the most well-meaning of the bunch, but she is also possibly the most blinded by her own life experiences.  She thinks in order to be happy, you just need to try.  You need to make yourself think happy thoughts, and say happy things, and tell people you are happy.  And this is the key to happiness according to my mother.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But I’m not going to go down the rabbit hole of blaming my parents for my problems or saying they raised me wrong or continue to raise me wrong.  My parents are products of their generation, acted upon heavily by their parents’ raising techniques, but also by their siblings and peers and environments and life experiences.  Just as every generation is a product of those same influences as far back as parents go.  So my mom, having lived a relatively horror-free life thus far, probably can just think happy thoughts and probably can just be happy.  Unless I missed a large chapter of her life-story, she has no reason to have ever encountered clinical depression on a personal level.  So when she says, “Just be more happy” I believe she is honestly giving me the best advice she knows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem is, I almost died a couple years ago.  And I’m not being dramatic when I say that.  I arrived at my gastroparesis diagnosis intimately familiar with every damaged part of my body, starving, counting my ribs daily, and having come to the slow realization that I could actually die before they figured out what was wrong with me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And honestly, I was going to let it happen if Gastroparesis wasn’t the answer.  I was so tired of the testing and probing and false leads and false hope.  GP was the only light at the end of a very dark tunnel, and, honestly, it’s not a very bright light.  It’s a lifetime supply of nausea, medication, food restrictions, along with the resulting anxiety and depression that comes with attempting to face your own death in your early twenties, and constant whispers in the back of your mind that just not eating is easier than this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So for me, happiness is still pretty far off.  I couldn’t even begin to describe what it would feel like or mean to me at this point.  That isn’t to say that I don’t feel happy at certain points in time.  I am married to a person I love very much, and she makes me happy.  I have some good friends and I have happy moments with them.  But overall happiness?  Being a happy person?  I don’t know how to be that.  My last therapist told me to set a goal that would make me happy when I accomplished it and I got so stressed out by that assignment I fired her.  I am living an unhappy life under unhappy circumstances and that’s just the way it is for now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But, in all honesty, the concept of happiness as my parents know it, and maybe even as their peers know it, and as I understand it, isn’t something that I can ever achieve.  My life, my environment, my peers, my spouse, my chronic illnesses, and the state of my country all preclude the American Dream of the white picket fence and the 2.4 kids and a dog.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I can’t speak for my entire generation, but the life I was promised growing up, the pathway to “happiness”, has slowly become impossible to attain.  And really, that type of happiness was based on the assumptions of previous generations.  They told us it should be our mission to do well in school, go to a good university, get a good degree, and then get a job in that field.  That is how you become happy according to every school counselor I’ve spoken to.  I have done all those things minus the last step, but things have happened in the world and in my life that make the emotion I would feel upon attaining the final step in the process stress rather than happiness.  Even the process of getting the degree stained the whole experience, making having a “good job” in “my field” a source of fear.  I constantly attempt to take that final step, knowing that once I do I will not get the reward I was promised.  I will not achieve “happiness”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That lack is partially because I have changed and it’s partially because the world has changed.  The job market is more saturated with degrees looking to get the “better” jobs we were promised and there just aren’t enough to go around anymore.  Companies are downsizing or moving to computerized processes, the economy is coming back or failing again depending on the day and who you ask, and the regular desk job employee doesn’t really exist for my generation anymore.  We are at work constantly stressed and tired, too afraid to take a day off but needing one to clear our minds.  My friends who have jobs don’t know how they got them and can offer no real advice on how to get one and who wants a job anyway?  Bosses are terrible and demanding and controlling all at once and your average desk job makes you a cog in a machine that most people my age want to tear down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But also, almost dying brings you a sort of clarity.  It makes me interact with people differently.  It makes me less likely to just tell myself to smile when my mother wants me to smile.  And really, I don’t unless I’m given something to smile about.  My face is just that way and my life is just that way.  And it makes my mom uncomfortable, because she was raised in a way and environment where talking about sadness and depression was strange and even rude.  Depressed people often got pushed to the perimeters of society with others suffering from mental or emotional illness and you only talked about the good things in life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’m not saying that because my mom told me that’s how she was raised, I’m saying that because I’ve witnessed it.  My grandmother did the same thing whenever someone was sad or troubled.  Someone in the family is sick?  No no they’re doing fine, say how about that episode of the Simpsons.  I didn’t know my grandfather was dying until my parents picked me up from school one day and told me we were going to Minnesota for the funeral.  Same with my grandmother.  I didn’t know she had cancer until we were in a hospital room with her and she was telling us about how they had to remove her stomach to get rid of the tumor.  And even then, it still killed her.  But we didn’t talk about it.  So I know where my mom’s fixation on just being happy and only putting happy things out there comes from.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve just become a different person.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don’t want to be the person lying in a hospital bed blindsiding people by telling them I’m actually dying.  I’m not satisfied just putting on a happy front for people anymore.  Most of the time I’ll tell people I’m doing ok for now, but you never know.  And I don’t see that as being a downer or a sad thing, it’s just the truth of my condition.  I have depression and anxiety and Gastroparesis and those are unhappy things that dominate my life with unhappy modifiers and I can be happy around them, but I’m not always going to be successful and sometimes I’m not even going to try.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also don’t have happiness as a personal goal anymore anyway.  It’s a vague concept some person made up a long time ago to keep people “on track” and keep the great machine rolling and honestly, I just don’t care anymore.  I don’t think I know anyone who’s truly happy all the time anyway, and I certainly don’t know anyone who claims to have achieved “happiness”.  I know people who like their jobs and I know people who are happily married, but those things aren’t happiness and that’s fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think what I’m trying to say is that you don’t have to be happy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I want to live in a world where everything is real instead of happy.  You’re depressed because your spouse is being a jerk?  That’s a valid emotion, talk to me about it.  You’re excited because you got a promotion? Great, tell me about your new job.  But this strange fixation with the fact that so-and-so “isn’t happy” needs to phase out of our culture.  Life isn’t just happy or just sad or just anything.  It’s a mixture of emotions and experiences and they are all valid and deserve their time in the sun.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you come to me and tell me to smile because you want me to be happy you’re wasting your time.  I am what I am.  I am usually experiencing something on the unhappy end of the scale, and I’m going to talk about that.  I need to talk about that.  I need people to understand what happened to me, because it’s happening to people like me all over the world and we are being ignored.  So I am unhappy and I am going to talk about it.  At the same time, when something happy comes along, I will also talk about that.  But I will not alter my face into a false construct of what you deem acceptable because you are uncomfortable with my unhappiness.  You need to find a way to deal with the fact that I went through an unimaginably life altering situation, a situation I didn’t expect to survive, and I’m still trying to put myself back together after it.  And that is not a happy process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That’s just how my face is, that’s just how my life is, and that’s just how I am.</p>

<p>So I’ve spent most of the day staring at an Instagram post from two years ago that showed up in my “On This Day” feed on Facebook.  It’s a picture of me the first time I had a mohawk, from my first few days at Cal, and before I had received any treatment for my Gastroparesis.  I know I hadn’t received treatment yet because another post from that feed shows me talking about how hard I struggled to get a visit with a doctor after I had moved up there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The timeline of my illness around that period is as follows: In May I finally got a referral to and an appointment with a Gastroenterologist.  Also in May, my weight officially hit double digits and my doctor started talking about hospitalization if I continued to lose weight.  Also in May, I was accepted to UC Berkeley.  In June, my Gastro finally ordered the emptying study I had been asking for, and later in the month diagnosed me with Idiopathic Gastroparesis.  In August, I moved to Berkeley, CA to attend university despite the fact that I continued to lose weight.  In September I took many pictures of myself and my firsts at the new school which are now surfacing on Facebook’s “On This Day”.  In October, I weighed in at an even 90 pounds, and a doctor finally put me on medication to control the nausea.  After that point, I was able to eat again, and began slowly regaining the weight I had lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jumping to today, the last time I was in a doctor’s office I weighed in at 185ish pounds.  The result of two years of hard work, medications, therapy, and nausea.  The problem is, I was aiming for 140, and I’ve kinda been giving myself a hard time for over shooting.  I’ve even gone so far as to look up ways to lose weight until I’m back in the range of 140 pounds.  I look at my stomach and thighs in the mirror and hate them, I count my stretch marks and wish they would disappear, I even get frustrated when I try on certain clothes from my “healthier” days and find that they don’t fit me anymore</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve done this without realizing how utterly ridiculous that is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I spent two agonizing years starving and shrinking and dying.  Medications, tests, days lost to side effects and illness and hardships that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy.  And here I am whining because I weigh “too much”, not in a medical sense, but in a personal goals sense.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then those pictures from my first days in Berkeley started coming across my feed again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve been staring at pictures of my arms without an ounce of fat on them, just enough muscle to function and bones distinctly protruding.  I can see my collar bone so defined it presses against the collars of my shirts and creates hollows in my skin where muscle and fat should be.  There are pictures I never shared from the same time period of myself standing in front of a mirror naked with every bone in my body clearly visible through my skin.  I counted my ribs in one of them today and I remembered feeling them through my clothes every time I scratched or wiped something off my shirt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I took those pictures so I would never forget that feeling and that time.  And then I forgot.  I got wrapped up in some weird insecurity complex about my stomach not being flat and my thighs not being thin and I completely forgot how hard I fought for that stomach and those things and those stretch marks.  I overshot by 40 pounds.  I&#8217;m too healthy for myself, I&#8217;ve regained too much weight.  It sounds stupid when I type it out, but that&#8217;s essentially what I&#8217;ve been telling myself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is my reminder to myself.  Those pictures are my reminder.  My weight is just a number.  My happiness lies in the way my thighs fill out skinny jeans and the way my arms jiggle when they move.  My body has been punished enough.  It continues to be punished every day by a disease that will never go away.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I need to stop adding to it.</p>

<p>There are two blog posts that I’ve been trying to write and I had originally split them because I thought they were completely separate problems.  But really one informs the other.  So, if while you’re reading this you feel like I lost the plot, stay with me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Monday I made dinner three times.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When eating alone, my dinner routine is generally the same.  I take my pre-meal pill, wait the allotted 30 minutes for it to take effect, and go downstairs to warm up my dinner.  I’ve been shopping a lot at Trader Joe’s because they have a lot of premade, frozen meals that I can just quickly heat up that pretty much stay within my dietary guidelines.  I usually shop on Monday for the entire week.  So when I went to the store Monday afternoon, I found out that a couple of my favorite items had been rotated out for new things that either didn’t fit into my guidelines or didn’t look interesting.  So I went looking around the store for replacements and landed on their chicken enchiladas and a bag of chicken fried rice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, the thing to mention about the items I usually eat is most of the time they are meat free.  Something like chicken fettuccine would be turned into mushroom fettuccine instead, so you still get a meaty quality without the meat.  Another thing to mention is that most of the time, the items I buy are precooked and all I am doing is warming them up later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Neither of these were the case with the chicken containing items I purchased on Monday, though I didn’t notice my mistake until I went down Monday night to make dinner.  Because they weren’t precooked, both items had a minimum temperature to heat the meal to in order for it to be safe to consume.  So when I took out the enchiladas, I thought, “Well that’s unfortunate, but whatever, I’ll do my best.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I popped the container into the microwave for the specified time, stuck the food thermometer into the center to gauge the temp, and discovered it wasn’t cooked all the way through.  Ok, back to the microwave, cook for a little more time, check again, it still isn’t cooked all the way through.  But you see, when I’m saying it isn’t cooked all the way through, I don’t actually know that.  All I know is that it isn’t reaching the specified safe temperature for consumption.  I go through the cycle a few more times, get extremely frustrated, and end up throwing away the enchiladas because I can’t get them to the point where I am convinced they are safe to eat.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then I did the same this with the chicken fried rice.  I had this thought in my head that the enchiladas were only such a problem because they were thick and full of filling and, after I calmed down, would need to be heated in the oven if I tried them in the future.  Surely the fried rice would be easier to heat to the correct temperature quickly in the microwave.  But it was not to be.  Even after heating the rice and chicken three times as long as specified, the chicken stayed twenty degrees too cold.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I got frustrated and threw that away too and sat on the floor and cried.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point in the post, I hear my therapist’s voice asking me why I would cry over something like that, so let me explain.  TV dinners, microwave dinners, instant snacks and pretty much anything you cook has a “safe” temperature printed on the box that you need to check your food for before eating it.  Before gastroparesis, I ignored that temperature warning and just ate whatever without checking.  Because I never got sick from a TV dinner, I never thought it was an important warning.  That is because, before gastroparesis, I had never had food poisoning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since June of 2013, when my gastroparesis symptoms started, I have had food poisoning-like symptoms four times from various meals.  One of those was a TV dinner I believe I improperly heated before eating.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyone who’s had food poisoning knows it isn’t a fun ordeal, but usually once the offending toxins clear your system you’re fine.  With my gastroparesis, even while take my nausea controlling medications, food poisoning means spending at least two days attached to the toilet and a further week or so being very gentle with my stomach.  It’s debilitating, and I do everything I can to avoid it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cut to Monday, when suddenly I couldn’t safely eat two meals I had really been looking forward to trying.  Two meals that I probably would have eaten without a thought before gastroparesis.  But on Monday the only thing going through my head was the anxiety surrounding unsafe food, the paralyzing fear that I would make myself sick from eating undercooked chicken, and the frustration with myself for those anxieties.  Part of it was the anxiety itself and part of it was that I was so mad at myself for being a crazy person about food temperature.  That’s why I sat down and cried in the middle of the kitchen floor instead of doing something productive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve told you this story so that I can make a point about myself and my life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lot of my friends and family talk about the day I will get better.  They talk about the day I will get a job, and the day I will have a family, and the day I will have a normal life.  They talk about how happy they are that I am healthy now, and when I bring up that I am not they deny it.  They talk about how God will heal me, they talk about yoga, they talk about connecting with my body, they talk about having a positive relationship with my illness, and they don’t see the truth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even some of you reading this don’t see the truth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don’t blame you.  You don’t see it because you aren’t living it.  You don’t see the day-to-day of my life.  You don’t see the little struggles I go through.  You don’t see me taking the pills and you don’t feel their side-effects.  Monday was not a fluke.  My anxiety rules my life.  My depression rules my life.  My gastroparesis rules my life.  The anxiety and the depression may someday come under control, may someday even go away entirely.  I don’t believe that possibility at this point in time, but that’s what my mental health doctors tell me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My gastroparesis will not go away.  Ever.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, I hear my therapist’s voice in my head saying I don’t know if that’s true and that stranger things have happened.  The thing is, my therapist is a new age, God-fearing, crunchy mom, hippy.  She believes in miracles and she doesn’t know a lot about gastroparesis.  My parents, also extremely religious, echo in my head, telling me that God will take my gastroparesis away someday and all I have to do is pray for it.  Members of my gastroparesis support group on Facebook echo in my head saying the same thing.  All we have to do is pray.  These people have said these things to me.  I’m not just imagining it.  My friends have said similar things.  It’s not, “If you get better…” it’s, “When you get better…”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is denial and denial is dangerous.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is dangerous to believe that I will one day magically get better.  It’s dangerous because it leads to forgetting that I’m sick on the positive side and getting frustrated that I’m not getting better on the negative side.  Denial means not dealing with the matter at hand.  Denial means pretending everything is ok and ignoring the signs that it isn’t.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I can’t be in denial anymore.  I don’t get that luxury.  I have to deal with the fact that I will be sick for the rest of my life.  I have to deal with it emotionally because if I don&#8217;t I have no chance of dealing with my anxiety or my depression.  The more I ignore and deny my gastroparesis, the more days I will spend sitting on the floor crying.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the more you ignore and deny it, the less I want to have you in my life.</p>

<p>When eating alone, my dinner routine is generally the same.  I take my pre-meal pill, wait the allotted 30 minutes for it to take effect, and go downstairs to warm up my dinner.  I’ve been shopping a lot at Trader Joe’s because they have a lot of premade, frozen meals that I can just quickly heat up that pretty much stay within my dietary guidelines.  I usually shop on Monday for the entire week.  So when I went to the store Monday afternoon, I found out that a couple of my favorite items had been rotated out for new things that either didn’t fit into my guidelines or didn’t look interesting.  So I went looking around the store for replacements and landed on their chicken enchiladas and a bag of chicken fried rice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, the thing to mention about the items I usually eat is most of the time they are meat free.  Something like chicken fettuccine would be turned into mushroom fettuccine instead, so you still get a meaty quality without the meat.  Another thing to mention is that most of the time, the items I buy are precooked and all I am doing is warming them up later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Neither of these were the case with the chicken containing items I purchased on Monday, though I didn’t notice my mistake until I went down Monday night to make dinner.  Because they weren’t precooked, both items had a minimum temperature to heat the meal to in order for it to be safe to consume.  So when I took out the enchiladas, I thought, “Well that’s unfortunate, but whatever, I’ll do my best.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I popped the container into the microwave for the specified time, stuck the food thermometer into the center to gauge the temp, and discovered it wasn’t cooked all the way through.  Ok, back to the microwave, cook for a little more time, check again, it still isn’t cooked all the way through.  But you see, when I’m saying it isn’t cooked all the way through, I don’t actually know that.  All I know is that it isn’t reaching the specified safe temperature for consumption.  I go through the cycle a few more times, get extremely frustrated, and end up throwing away the enchiladas because I can’t get them to the point where I am convinced they are safe to eat.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then I did the same this with the chicken fried rice.  I had this thought in my head that the enchiladas were only such a problem because they were thick and full of filling and, after I calmed down, would need to be heated in the oven if I tried them in the future.  Surely the fried rice would be easier to heat to the correct temperature quickly in the microwave.  But it was not to be.  Even after heating the rice and chicken three times as long as specified, the chicken stayed twenty degrees too cold.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I got frustrated and threw that away too and sat on the floor and cried.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point in the post, I hear my therapist’s voice asking me why I would cry over something like that, so let me explain.  TV dinners, microwave dinners, instant snacks and pretty much anything you cook has a “safe” temperature printed on the box that you need to check your food for before eating it.  Before gastroparesis, I ignored that temperature warning and just ate whatever without checking.  Because I never got sick from a TV dinner, I never thought it was an important warning.  That is because, before gastroparesis, I had never had food poisoning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since June of 2013, when my gastroparesis symptoms started, I have had food poisoning-like symptoms four times from various meals.  One of those was a TV dinner I believe I improperly heated before eating.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyone who’s had food poisoning knows it isn’t a fun ordeal, but usually once the offending toxins clear your system you’re fine.  With my gastroparesis, even while take my nausea controlling medications, food poisoning means spending at least two days attached to the toilet and a further week or so being very gentle with my stomach.  It’s debilitating, and I do everything I can to avoid it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cut to Monday, when suddenly I couldn’t safely eat two meals I had really been looking forward to trying.  Two meals that I probably would have eaten without a thought before gastroparesis.  But on Monday the only thing going through my head was the anxiety surrounding unsafe food, the paralyzing fear that I would make myself sick from eating undercooked chicken, and the frustration with myself for those anxieties.  Part of it was the anxiety itself and part of it was that I was so mad at myself for being a crazy person about food temperature.  That’s why I sat down and cried in the middle of the kitchen floor instead of doing something productive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve told you this story so that I can make a point about myself and my life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lot of my friends and family talk about the day I will get better.  They talk about the day I will get a job, and the day I will have a family, and the day I will have a normal life.  They talk about how happy they are that I am healthy now, and when I bring up that I am not they deny it.  They talk about how God will heal me, they talk about yoga, they talk about connecting with my body, they talk about having a positive relationship with my illness, and they don’t see the truth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even some of you reading this don’t see the truth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don’t blame you.  You don’t see it because you aren’t living it.  You don’t see the day-to-day of my life.  You don’t see the little struggles I go through.  You don’t see me taking the pills and you don’t feel their side-effects.  Monday was not a fluke.  My anxiety rules my life.  My depression rules my life.  My gastroparesis rules my life.  The anxiety and the depression may someday come under control, may someday even go away entirely.  I don’t believe that possibility at this point in time, but that’s what my mental health doctors tell me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My gastroparesis will not go away.  Ever.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, I hear my therapist’s voice in my head saying I don’t know if that’s true and that stranger things have happened.  The thing is, my therapist is a new age, God-fearing, crunchy mom, hippy.  She believes in miracles and she doesn’t know a lot about gastroparesis.  My parents, also extremely religious, echo in my head, telling me that God will take my gastroparesis away someday and all I have to do is pray for it.  Members of my gastroparesis support group on Facebook echo in my head saying the same thing.  All we have to do is pray.  These people have said these things to me.  I’m not just imagining it.  My friends have said similar things.  It’s not, “If you get better…” it’s, “When you get better…”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is denial and denial is dangerous.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is dangerous to believe that I will one day magically get better.  It’s dangerous because it leads to forgetting that I’m sick on the positive side and getting frustrated that I’m not getting better on the negative side.  Denial means not dealing with the matter at hand.  Denial means pretending everything is ok and ignoring the signs that it isn’t.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I can’t be in denial anymore.  I don’t get that luxury.  I have to deal with the fact that I will be sick for the rest of my life.  I have to deal with it emotionally because if I don&#8217;t I have no chance of dealing with my anxiety or my depression.  The more I ignore and deny my gastroparesis, the more days I will spend sitting on the floor crying.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the more you ignore and deny it, the less I want to have you in my life.</p>

<p>On January 1st of 2016 I made a New Year’s resolution to take more selfies.  The thought process was that I was slowly drowning in a vat of self-hate and I wanted to start taking steps toward having a more healthy and loving self-image.  I considered baby steps when contemplating this journey, because I knew that turning my view of myself around would take a lot of work.  I knew this because I’d done it before.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I was a freshman in high school, I had a crush on a boy.  It wasn’t my first crush, and it wouldn’t be my last, but it was the first one in high school.  As it turned out, we had mutual friends who were sympathetic to my cause, who thought we would make a cute couple, who knew that I wouldn’t approach him myself, and who genuinely thought he would return my feelings.  I don’t know exactly how the conversations went, but I found out through him that one or two of our mutual friends had mentioned to him that I was interested in him, and they passed along their own opinions that he should ask me out.  Instead, in the same message that I learned this information, he informed me that he had been interested in me at one point, but something that I had said or done over the course of our interactions had convinced him that I was a raging bitch and he had no interest in even befriending me, much less dating me.  Being the emotionally immature teenager that I was, this devastated me.  Someone who I liked, who I wanted some sort of relationship with, who I didn’t even really interact with outside of classes, thought I was enough of a toxic bitch that he wanted nothing to do with me.  And this wasn’t a case of hearsay, he contacted me himself to tell me this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was probably the first time I sat down and examined myself and the way I acted towards other people.  I had been an angry person through the end of elementary school (about fourth or fifth grade) until the beginning of high school for various reasons, but I had never really considered how this made me appear to people around me.  I even went to my closest friends and asked if they agreed with his assessment, and the responses, though more kindly worded, all rounded out to the same message.  I wasn’t the worst person in the world, but I was a bitch and people didn’t know how to handle me because of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hindsight being 20/20, I was a little hard on myself as a result of all this introspection.  I basically clammed up in class and clubs and only talked to people when they addressed me first, and even then I usually found my words too harsh or sarcastic.  I wasn’t satisfied with any of my interactions with my peers to a point that I began to convince myself that no one actually wanted to be friends with me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I still struggle with the standards I set for myself during that time.  I’ve come to embrace the parts of my inner bitch that I deem necessary, but I still feel nervous interacting with people I want to be friends with.  I still struggle with anxiety surrounding conversations and interactions I have with my peers.  I constantly wonder if people actually like me or if they secretly think I’m a raging bitch.  But at the same time, I’ve come to understand that I expect honesty from myself and that is sometimes more important that whether or not someone likes me.  The point is that my self-image struggles for many years have surrounded how I express myself, whether or not I express myself the way I intend, and whether or not the way I present myself is authentic without being unnecessarily harsh.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After I became sick, my struggle shifted toward my body-image.  I have said in the past that I had never had body-image issues in the past.  I was never really conventionally attractive or unattractive, I just was.  My body functioned and I was happy with it and comfortable in it.  Since June of 2013, I had slowly begun to view my body as an adversary.  And so at the beginning of 2016, I began to contemplate ways of changing this mindset, knowing my past with self-image issues, and knowing in what ways I struggle with setting boundaries and altering my own thought processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So my first baby step was to take more selfies.  I thought if I had more opportunities to find myself attractive and view my actual body in a positive light, it would help and I didn’t foresee any negative anxieties growing out of it.  And for the most part, I succeeded.  I took more selfies, I liked the way I looked in them, I posted them to the internet, and I hated my body a little less.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What I didn’t foresee were all the external forces that would arise to continue beating down my self-esteem while I attempted to shore it up with my baby steps.  Admittedly, my plans were not the best laid.  I didn’t really have a step two in mind other than a vague plan to keep my weight in a healthy zone and some daydreams about light exercise to keep me feeling good.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Those plans vanished when I began to realize I had no idea how to be healthy with gastroparesis.  There are some vague guidelines on the internet about squashes and smoothies, but the consensus seems to be eat whatever will stay down and take vitamins for the rest.  The easiest foods for me seem to be sugary or full of carbs and, therefore, not the best for maintaining weight.  As for exercise, if my experiences in New York were any indication, the best I can do is take short, slow walks, at least until it cools down more outside.  Also not the best circumstances for feeling healthy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So what inevitably happened was I spent two-ish years regaining weight, back up to my healthy zone, and then I continued to gain weight because I have no idea how to stop other than eating less.  At last check-up, I weighed 180 pounds.  Granted, that’s not too high a number for someone of my height and build, but it’s higher than I wanted to go, and that was a few months ago.  The unforeseen side-effect of this weight gain, and the hit to my self-image, was me slowly becoming unable to fit into any of my clothes.  This wasn’t a problem when I was losing weight because I had hope that I would eventually gain that weight back and be able to fit into those clothes again.  It has become a problem now because there are only two reasons I would begin losing weight again; I begin eating less (an unhealthy option), or I have to stop taking the medication that makes me able to eat at all (a very unhealthy option).  And the process of slowly outgrowing all of my clothes has not been positive for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So instead of slowly feeling better about myself, I’ve been slowly spiralling down into depression and self-hate and body hate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reason I’m thinking about all of this is that I have a new therapist who is very crunchy granola, and she began our meetings by attempting to figure out how I can reconnect with my body in a healthy and positive way.  Her suggestions were all yoga and swimming and healthy eating and displayed an expected lack of understanding of my body’s limitations.  It was our first meeting and I don’t expect her to be an expert on gastroparesis.  But it got me thinking back to that optimism I had in January of 2016, and I started wondering about things that I could actually do to make myself feel better about my body.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my head, I keep going back to eating better and finding a way to exercise.  But at the same time, I don’t feel like expecting my body to change is a positive approach.  It’s taken me a long time to accept that my gastroparesis is likely going to be a lifelong ailment.  I am always going to struggle with this.  But I don’t have to continually struggle with my body-image.  So now it’s time to lay some better plans.  How do I accept my new body with all it’s future changes and challenges?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t think taking more selfies is going to be an aggressive enough approach.</p>

<p>So Skoddie and I have been having a conversation over the last few weeks or months about me and my depression and what I’m doing with life and other related subjects.  Part of the issue of discussion is the question, “what do I do now?”  And this question has been plaguing me since I graduated college because, up to that point, my purpose in life and my big life altering goal had been to get my degree.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Which is a big deal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I spent pretty much 25 years of my life building up to obtaining a degree from the best university I could afford, in a subject I enjoyed and was passionate about.  And, despite the setbacks, obstacles, and depression, I got it.  I have a little piece of paper in an envelope next to my desk that represents all of the work I’ve completed since I started kindergarten at 4 years old.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And while that’s an achievement I am extremely proud of, It isn’t a goal I really set for myself.  I mean, no one told me to set my sights on UC Berkeley, no one told me literature was the subject to choose, but not going to college was never really an option.  The question I was asked when I was growing up wasn’t, “Will you go to college after high school?” it was, “Where will you go?”  It was assumed that I would go to college and get a degree, so I did.  It was a strange mix of self-set goals and societal expectations, and I’m done with it now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, now what?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Part of the problem is that along the way I gained severe mental and physical illnesses.  And part of the problem of depression is that it makes me want to lay in bed and do nothing until I die.  And part of the problem of gastroparesis is that I can’t do much, including a lot of things I really enjoy, so laying in bed until I die seems like a really attractive option.  It’s a combination that makes it hard to set goals and get things done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I spent about six months applying and interviewing for jobs that require English degrees for a lot of reasons.  Chronic Illnesses are expensive so I need an income, almost everyone in my life told me that’s what I was supposed to do after college, and I didn’t really know what else to do.  So Skoddie helped me create a nice resume, I contacted people who would act as references, and I threw myself out there.  But over the course of those months, for whatever reason, I started to more and more hate the idea of getting a conventional office job.  I started to doubt my ability to obtain such a job, I started to doubt my physical ability to work such a job, and I started to ask myself why I was trying to get one anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because I’ve never wanted a conventional office desk job.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I temped a lot in offices during my city college time and I hated it.  I hated everything about it.  I can’t even say why.  It might have been the type of work that temps tend to be assigned, it might have been the lack of sincerity I sensed in the interpersonal interactions of the people working in the offices, it might have been the lack of free thought and the staleness of the “creativity” involved.  I don’t honestly know if temping just gave me a skewed image of offices, I just know I don’t want to work in one if I can avoid it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So Skoddie and I started talking about alternatives to the office jobs I had been applying for, and, naturally, we landed on writing.  Because I love writing and if there’s one thing I am confident about and one thing I know I can do, it’s write.  I used to do stupid shit when I was bored in high school like pick an essay topic that I knew was BS and see if I could convince the teacher that I was actually right. I had to stop senior year because my English teacher caught me at it and made me re-write an essay I had done because “this is well written but you and I both know you don’t believe it”.  I think more of my teachers knew I was full of shit along the years, but he’s the only one who said anything.  And then I got into college and found out scholars get paid to do that kind of stuff and realized I was just practicing for my college career without knowing it.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem with writing though, is that my life has changed drastically since I used to write vampire horror stories and Harry Potter fanfiction in high school.  My outlook on life has changed, my opinions on a lot of social issues have changed, my understanding of myself, my sexuality, my body, and my mind has changed.  And If I’m going to write for a living, I want to write about that.  Not just those topics, I want to write something that means something to me.  That isn’t to say my one-shot horror stories didn’t mean anything, but they don’t say what I want to say anymore.  So If I’m going to write for a living, I need to figure out what I want to say, and how to say it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another part of the discussion with Skoddie about living with my depression and finding what I’m doing with my life has centered around figuring out what about life excites me.  I tend to think more of what am I passionate about.  Why am I living?  What am I living for?  Illness makes these questions hard to answer.  Because depression limits the things that I care about, and gastroparesis further limits the things I’m able to care about and do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So what am I passionate about?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s hard to identify passion sitting at a desk writing a blog post.  I love reading and writing.  I love dancing and bike riding and frisbee golf.  I love knitting and crocheting.  I love makeup and nail polish and baking and tea.  I love animals, especially dogs.  I love children.  I love this blog.  But am I passionate about those things?  Can I make a living doing them or turn that love into something I can live with doing?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of those things, I have to cross off the list because of gastroparesis.  I can dance on a good day, but those are few and far between now.  I can’t ride a bike or golf until it cools down because I overheat easily now.  I can’t be around children or animals much due to various anxieties and illnesses.  I don’t have the money, energy, or skill to professionally do makeup or nails.  Some of those are solvable issues and some of them aren’t, but for the immediate future my list is shortened.  And it would take passion or excitement to overcome the drag of depression and get those issues resolved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That brings us back to writing and what I want to say with my writing.  Because I do love this blog and I do love reading and writing.  I know I am passionate about writing because I sit here and do it in my free time, despite the depression nagging at me to get back into bed.  But this blog contains all the writing I’ve done since I graduated minus some cover letters and posts I decided to keep private.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are the things I care about most, these things I share with you in my private part of the internet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I care about women’s rights and LGBT+ rights and healthcare and safe spaces for PoC.  I care about visibility for invisible illnesses.  I care about food health and nutrition and affordable access to food and food information.  I care about mental health care and support for mental health patients.  I care that so many of my friends and family don’t know about these things and how they affect so many millions of people.  I care about these things so deeply.  It hurts my heart when I have to explain what depression is like to another person, but at the same time I am overjoyed that they asked and possibly will listen to the answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are the things I care about and want to write about.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now how do I do it?</p>

<p>So Skoddie and I have been having a conversation over the last few weeks or months about me and my depression and what I’m doing with life and other related subjects.  Part of the issue of discussion is the question, “what do I do now?”  And this question has been plaguing me since I graduated college because, up to that point, my purpose in life and my big life altering goal had been to get my degree.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Which is a big deal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I spent pretty much 25 years of my life building up to obtaining a degree from the best university I could afford, in a subject I enjoyed and was passionate about.  And, despite the setbacks, obstacles, and depression, I got it.  I have a little piece of paper in an envelope next to my desk that represents all of the work I’ve completed since I started kindergarten at 4 years old.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And while that’s an achievement I am extremely proud of, It isn’t a goal I really set for myself.  I mean, no one told me to set my sights on UC Berkeley, no one told me literature was the subject to choose, but not going to college was never really an option.  The question I was asked when I was growing up wasn’t, “Will you go to college after high school?” it was, “Where will you go?”  It was assumed that I would go to college and get a degree, so I did.  It was a strange mix of self-set goals and societal expectations, and I’m done with it now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, now what?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Part of the problem is that along the way I gained severe mental and physical illnesses.  And part of the problem of depression is that it makes me want to lay in bed and do nothing until I die.  And part of the problem of gastroparesis is that I can’t do much, including a lot of things I really enjoy, so laying in bed until I die seems like a really attractive option.  It’s a combination that makes it hard to set goals and get things done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I spent about six months applying and interviewing for jobs that require English degrees for a lot of reasons.  Chronic Illnesses are expensive so I need an income, almost everyone in my life told me that’s what I was supposed to do after college, and I didn’t really know what else to do.  So Skoddie helped me create a nice resume, I contacted people who would act as references, and I threw myself out there.  But over the course of those months, for whatever reason, I started to more and more hate the idea of getting a conventional office job.  I started to doubt my ability to obtain such a job, I started to doubt my physical ability to work such a job, and I started to ask myself why I was trying to get one anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because I’ve never wanted a conventional office desk job.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I temped a lot in offices during my city college time and I hated it.  I hated everything about it.  I can’t even say why.  It might have been the type of work that temps tend to be assigned, it might have been the lack of sincerity I sensed in the interpersonal interactions of the people working in the offices, it might have been the lack of free thought and the staleness of the “creativity” involved.  I don’t honestly know if temping just gave me a skewed image of offices, I just know I don’t want to work in one if I can avoid it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So Skoddie and I started talking about alternatives to the office jobs I had been applying for, and, naturally, we landed on writing.  Because I love writing and if there’s one thing I am confident about and one thing I know I can do, it’s write.  I used to do stupid shit when I was bored in high school like pick an essay topic that I knew was BS and see if I could convince the teacher that I was actually right. I had to stop senior year because my English teacher caught me at it and made me re-write an essay I had done because “this is well written but you and I both know you don’t believe it”.  I think more of my teachers knew I was full of shit along the years, but he’s the only one who said anything.  And then I got into college and found out scholars get paid to do that kind of stuff and realized I was just practicing for my college career without knowing it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem with writing though, is that my life has changed drastically since I used to write vampire horror stories and Harry Potter fanfiction in high school.  My outlook on life has changed, my opinions on a lot of social issues have changed, my understanding of myself, my sexuality, my body, and my mind has changed.  And If I’m going to write for a living, I want to write about that.  Not just those topics, I want to write something that means something to me.  That isn’t to say my one-shot horror stories didn’t mean anything, but they don’t say what I want to say anymore.  So If I’m going to write for a living, I need to figure out what I want to say, and how to say it.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So what am I passionate about?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<p>I am tired today. I&#8217;ve been tired for a week. I am bone-achingly, body-numbingly tired.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve been on vacation for the last seven days. I was really excited for this vacation for a number of reasons, the most prevalent of which being I have never been to New York and I was really looking forward to seeing it. My mother-in-law was part of a choir which was invited to perform Kirke Mechem’s <strong>Songs of the Slave</strong> at Carnegie Hall. That was the purpose of our trip, but of course that wasn&#8217;t all that we were going to do while on the east coast and in the great state of New York, where I had never been.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I did go into the trip with a certain amount of trepidation. I can&#8217;t be very active while dealing with my various issues and my stomach can basically revolt at any time it chooses. Leaving the house is hard. Physical activity is hard. Planning ahead is hard. Even walking long distances is hard. I don&#8217;t just have the nausea to deal with. I have low energy, I have abdominal pains, and I have anxiety, germophobia, and depression to take into account. But I was assured my mother in law, who was planning the New York leg of the trip, would take it slow and I had high hopes for the trip.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And for the most part I had a good time. I got to see a lot of sights and shows in New York, we visited Boston where my wife used to live, and I got to try a lot of new things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But along the way I learned that I am disabled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a title I have been very reluctant to claim since my diagnosis. Part of my reluctance is denial, and the hope that I will eventually find a way to do all the things I want to do again.  I had high hopes for my physical health improving and I didn&#8217;t want to claim disability and then renege on that claim later, if I got better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another part of that reluctance is a hesitation to appropriate a title I don&#8217;t deserve. And that reluctance stems from the self doubt anxiety and depression instill in sufferers. I can tell you right now, with my logical mind in gear, that my fears are based in my depression. But this week has proven to me that gastroparesis is a disability. But another part of my brain, the part steeped in anxiety and depression that I have named Fetzig, asks me how I can dare claim that title for myself when there are people who are so much worse off than me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of the day, I was physically capable of doing more than a lot of people with disabilities can do. I walked the streets of New York and Boston without aid of crutches or a wheelchair. I rode the subways of both cities and was only slightly afraid of the germs my immune system was being bombarded with. I even ate food most gastroparesis sufferers daydream about. But I did not do these things without aid, and that, I think, is the important point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of the day, I wasn&#8217;t able to do the things an able-bodied person would have been able to do in my stead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our first full day of sightseeing left me gasping and weak and in pain. I was nauseous, I was aching, and I couldn&#8217;t walk home at the end of the night.  We had visited the 9/11 memorial museum, gone through Wall Street to find the famous Charging Bull and Fearless Girl statues, and seen a Broadway production of “The Book of Mormon”. I couldn&#8217;t finish the museum, we had to leave without walking through all the exhibits. I was stumbling through finding the statues we wanted to see. I was so tired during the play I couldn&#8217;t even bring myself to enjoy what I was watching.  Throughout the day, I was liberally taking my nausea medications to keep my stomach in order.  At the end of the day, my body would no longer respond to my commands. I will treasure all of the memories of that day, but I will be recovering from it for a long time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You see, what happened was my mother in law didn&#8217;t realize I couldn&#8217;t keep that pace. She knows I am sick and she knows I get tired easily, but she didn&#8217;t understand the full scope of the problem. So when she planned a day in New York, she planned like all of the participants would be able to do what any abled person could do. She was confused when I didn&#8217;t want to walk through the entire museum. She was confused when I was tired and hurting after sitting through “The Book of Mormon”. Because an abled person would be able to sit in a nice theatre and watch a play for a couple of hours and feel fine.  But for me it was physically draining.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the first time, I realized that I am not abled. I realized the true meaning of losing spoons and not having the energy to do what I wanted to do, and I realized my body has more limits than I thought it did.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the next day was more of the same, though we attempted to take it at a slower pace. I found myself stumbling slowly and painfully through the streets of New York and, at the end of the day, we had to take an Uber home though the subway was less than a mile&#8217;s walk. And over the course of the week I was less and less able to walk to the subway station, and I was less and less able to handle the heat, and I was more reliant on breaks and Uber and medications and shortcuts. And I&#8217;m sitting on an airplane writing this blog post aching and tired and sick and I feel disabled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am disabled. I have a disability. And I need to stop telling myself that I don&#8217;t deserve that title or that others have it worse.  You don&#8217;t earn a wheelchair or a pair of crutches. You don&#8217;t get a certification card that announces the holder is disabled. No one deserves to be called disabled. It is a condition that some of us have. You don&#8217;t earn it from some sort of disability contest. Who&#8217;s Worse Off? the game show doesn&#8217;t exist. But a week trying to keep up with my physically abled mother in law certainly does.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And maybe if I recognize what my body is telling me and reach for some of those aids others make use of, I can avoid feeling the aching lack of energy I feel today.</p>

<p>There are some things about foreign cultures that, when I learn them, make me wonder why the American norm is different.  In this case, when I was learning German in high school, one of the earliest lessons was greetings and how to respond to them and the grammar and sentence structures surrounding that part of German.  Naturally, they have a phrase that basically translates to the english “how are you?” or “how’s it going?” that I remember but can no longer spell.  But, the thing our teacher made very clear was the cultural difference surrounding this phrase.  In Germany, if you ask “How are you?” you get an answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A real answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, you don’t ask someone how they are unless you are prepared to have a serious conversation about that person’s day or life since they’ve last seen you.  And in America, at least everywhere I’ve been, the culture is completely different.  You ask “how are you?” and the person is expected to respond with something along the lines “good, how are you?”.  No matter what, the expected response is a polite canned phrase before you continue on with the conversation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’m not saying this is how every single conversation like that goes in America.  Among close friends and family, sometimes the question is sincere and the response should actually be about how your life is going.  But for the most part it’s a polite nothing exchange.  And it kind of bothers me because in Germany this greeting signals a sincere desire to connect with your conversation partner whereas in America it&#8217;s basically a useless filler phrase.</p>
</div>

<p>I started thinking about this more since I’ve been sick and especially since I’ve been going to church since I’ve come home from college.  When I left for college I weighed 95 pounds and was very sick.  Over the course of two years in Berkeley, I got on medication to help my nausea, gained weight, got on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication, and came back generally looking, but not feeling, healthier.  I went to church on Sunday and a lot of the members who know me there were very happy to see me and were talking about how much healthier I looked and all that happy jazz.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And a lot of them started the conversation with, “You look so good, how are you?”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my church community, I have a hard time telling who is being sincere and who is being polite, so my gut reaction is to give the canned response to all of them.  “Oh, I’m doing well.  How are you?”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And honestly, that response is a lie every time.  If you ask me how I’m doing and I say I’m well, I am lying because I don’t know if you actually want to know how I’m doing because that’s how the culture is in America.  But I’m probably going to continue telling people I’m doing well because I don’t know if they care, I don’t want to make them uncomfortable, I don’t want to make them sad, or some other similar reason because that’s considered polite and correct.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, in case you actually care about how I’m doing, I’m going to tell you right now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Hey Amy, how are you?”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Oh, well some days are better than others, but generally I’ve been feeling pretty unwell.  I’ve gained weight, but I still feel nauseous every day, after almost every meal.  My depression is fighting really hard to take over my life, and some days it wins.  As I’m writing this, my depression is winning.  I didn’t get out of bed until noon today, I only got dressed because I wanted tea, and I only wanted tea because the motions of getting out of bed made me very nauseous and tea generally helps.  And even on my good days I only have the energy for limited social interactions and there is a time limit on my ability to be in public.  A limit I generally only discover by exceeding it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve been having a lot of trouble figuring out what I want to do with my life now.  I’ve utterly failed at getting a job since December, and I can’t decide if I’m happy or sad about that because I don’t actually know if I can physically sit at a desk all day and work an office job.  But any semblance of me being an independent adult depends on me having an income and livelihood of my own.  Because I&#8217;m sick but I&#8217;m not sick enough to be on government assistance, having an income means having a job of some sort.  Besides that, the one thing that I spent much of my life wanting to do is work with children in some capacity.  And I can’t do that anymore because I am constantly sick.  So I don’t know what to do with myself and my newly restricted and shortened life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, I’ve been struggling with my anxiety, my germophobia, my growing sense of personal failure, and the fact that I feel like no one actually likes me.  All of these things, I’m told, are side effects of my anxiety disorder and my depression, but I still can’t figure out how to control any of them.  This means that I constantly question my personal relationships, my self worth, and whether or not touching my dog will transfer some germs onto my hands that will make me sick.  I know this all sounds insane, but that is how my brain works now.  And that is how I’ve been feeling lately.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>How are you?</p>

<p>There are some things about foreign cultures that, when I learn them, make me wonder why the American norm is different.  In this case, when I was learning German in high school, one of the earliest lessons was greetings and how to respond to them and the grammar and sentence structures surrounding that part of German.  Naturally, they have a phrase that basically translates to the english “how are you?” or “how’s it going?” that I remember but can no longer spell.  But, the thing our teacher made very clear was the cultural difference surrounding this phrase.  In Germany, if you ask “How are you?” you get an answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A real answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, you don’t ask someone how they are unless you are prepared to have a serious conversation about that person’s day or life since they’ve last seen you.  And in America, at least everywhere I’ve been, the culture is completely different.  You ask “how are you?” and the person is expected to respond with something along the lines “good, how are you?”.  No matter what, the expected response is a polite canned phrase before you continue on with the conversation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’m not saying this is how every single conversation like that goes in America.  Among close friends and family, sometimes the question is sincere and the response should actually be about how your life is going.  But for the most part it’s a polite nothing exchange.  And it kind of bothers me because in Germany this greeting signals a sincere desire to connect with your conversation partner whereas in America it&#8217;s basically a useless filler phrase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I started thinking about this more since I’ve been sick and especially since I’ve been going to church since I’ve come home from college.

<p>Hello my kitten, my baby, my beauty, my friend.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I saw you yesterday tired and failing.  I saw you yesterday and held you in my hands.  There have been many times, my beauty, my friend, that I thought you would leave me, but I saw you yesterday and knew that this… this is the end.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I remember when you came to me, tiny and fierce.  You came to me and I carried you with all the tenderness in my 5-year-old heart.  You wouldn’t be a good pet, they told me.  You were feral and strong.  You wouldn’t make a good pet, yet I carried you home.  Do you remember, my beauty, my friend, hiding behind the boxes in the garage?  You earned your name that first night,  attacking everything that walked by your lair.   Do you remember meeting the dog and do you remember teaching him who was the boss of the yard?  But also, you remember, curling up next to him when the nights got cold?  Tiny and fierce and feral and strong, my beauty, my friend, you made it your home.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That summer was the first year the rats never came.  We didn’t find their droppings behind the toolbox and we never saw their little tails whisk out of sight.  We didn’t hear the scratches in the rafters on cool summer nights.  We heard you though, my beauty, my friend.  We heard you prowling the shelves and the stacks.  We saw your eyes glowing out of the darkness, heard you growl and hiss and bite.  That was the year the rats never came until we found them under the deck in the yard.  Trophies one and all of your hard work, your fierceness, your joy.  Ours was the only house on the street that never had rats again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I remember, my beauty, the first time you went to the vet.  They told me you would come home tired and you would never have babies and my 5-year-old heart thought that was unfair.  We didn’t ask you if you were a mother, after all.  But the first day you came home, angry and tired, you escaped to the yard.  I remember, my friend, finding your bird trophies along the walk that first day and I realized you were fine.  A mother you weren’t, my beauty, my friend, but even with stitches across your belly you were feral and strong.  And I loved you that day with all my 5-year-old heart, my beauty, my friend, tiny and fierce, feral and strong.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I remember you, beauty, growing old with me.  Stalking across the yard in search of your next prey.  Rolling in the dirt, exposing your belly to the sun.  Letting the young children pat your head on their way to school.  I remember you waited for them every morning, even in the summer when no school was open.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I knew you were growing older and slower when I found you in the shed.  You had been missing for days and I thought the worst.  Your neck was a mass of infected sores, you were shivering and scared.  But you came when I called you, tender and tired.  The vet told me you wouldn’t survive the attack, but my 5-year-old heart knew better.  You were a fighter, my beauty, my friend, and and I found your bandages in a pile on my bed. You were back in the yard a month later, better than before.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I remember from then on, my beauty, my friend, after that first attack, you became tender and strong.  I was confused that first day you waited for me after school.  You waited I don’t know how long, and came running to my car, prize in your mouth and pride in your lines.  I was proud of you then, in all my aged 5-year-old heart.  What cat can survive a coyote attack, yet there you were with a lizard for a gift.  I loved you that day and everyday after.  You came to my car with presents and pride and received the only reward I could give, my love and affection.  It was Spring time then, my beauty, my friend, and you brightened my days to no end.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second time I found you under the house they told me it was the end.  You were 15 then, and tired. The surgery you needed was hard.  And they were right, you were never the same, but still you came home, battered and old.  And your hunting days were behind you, and the house was your home.  And the rats never came back, though you had retired then.  And I loved you all I could, with my 5-year-old heart.  Battered and tired were we, my beauty, my friend, but you carried on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And I remember the day I had to leave you.  I thought on that day that it was the end.  You were 18 and tired, going blind and moving slow.  I would be gone for two years, and I thought my beauty would leave me then.  But still you persisted, growing more tired and grumpy each year.  I feared for you each day while I was gone, and returned to you still joyful, independent, and strong.  You didn’t remember me then, but I remembered you.  You were my baby, my kitten, my beauty, and my friend.  Feral and strong, 20 years old.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And now here we are, my beauty, my friend.  And this time, this time it was the end.  I was not there when your journey came to its end, when you closed your eyes, when your spirit wended. I held you yesterday, your body so frail, and wept for our lives and the paths we now tread.  I love you my kitten, my baby, my beauty, my friend.  My 5-year-old heart is yours to the end.</p>

<p>I’ve always had a strange connection with my dreams.  Until very recently, I dreamed exclusively in nightmares.  At the same time, I almost never remember my dreams.  I knew they were nightmares because I woke up terrified, shaking, and sometimes too scared to look out from my covers to examine my room for a physical manifestation of whatever had just invaded my subconscious.  I was easily scared as a child, and because I didn’t remember my dreams, I never knew what was coming to get me.  I usually remembered a rush of noise, flashes of brightly lit and somehow unsettling colors, but nothing concrete.  Therefore, any misshapen shadow or unexplained noise could be perceived as something unknown creeping out of my nightmares into the living world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Those are the first type of dreams I had and I still have them today and still consider them nightmares.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second type of nightmare is the recurring ones.  These ones are everything the abstract nightmares aren’t.  They are clear, the danger is easily identifiable, and when I wake up I remember them vividly.  The difference is these ones are about things I’m actually afraid of in the living world, and so I don’t wake up terrified because they can’t get into my room.  They aren’t the unknown, they aren’t illogical and hard to describe.  In fact, according to most people, they aren’t even nightmare worthy.  I’ll eventually describe a couple to you and you can decide if that last bit is true or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve also always believed these recurring nightmares serve a purpose.  They aren’t always the exact same dream, but they’re variations on the original, and they happen at particular times in my life.  Like I said earlier, I feel weird about my dreams.  The abstract, immaterial ones scare the crap out of me, but I always eventually fall back asleep and they don’t affect me the next day at all.  The recurring ones wake me up and keep me awake thinking about them.  They affect my mindset about certain things, and they’ve even caused me to make life-altering decisions.  So they are important to me and when I have them I take them seriously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the same time, I don’t believe in the mystical version of dream reading.  I don’t believe my dreams will tell my fortune or hold mystical truths about myself.  At the same time, my recurring nightmares are not “just dreams”.  They’re truths of a certain variety, maybe just in a form my mind can understand better when I’m sleeping.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most popular recurring nightmare is something I call “The Tsunami Dream”.  I call it most popular because it happens the most often of all my recurring dreams.  In its original form, I’m standing on a beach, sometimes alone and sometimes with other people.  The first time I had it the beach was a familiar one, but it isn’t always.  In all versions of the dream, there is a beach and a cliff lining it.  This type of beach occurs in my hometown, but they’re common enough other places that you might know what I’m talking about.  Basically, there’s ocean, then sand, then a cliff, then the rest of the city or whatever.  That part is fuzzy in my dream because I never get there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, I’m standing on a beach and there’s a cliff at my back and the ocean in front of me.  And in the ocean, coming towards me, is one of those towering movie tsunamis than don’t actually occur many places in real life and certainly don’t occur where I live.  You know those giant walls of water that defy gravity and ocean physics and every other law of the land?  It’s always one of those.  And there’s always a choice I have to make before the tsunami reaches me, and I can never make the choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first time I had the dream I was fairly young, and the choice was do I gather my towel and stuff before I run away or not.  I remember this iteration of the dream vividly because I woke up feeling really stupid for having dreamed it.  But in the nightmare, I picked up, dropped, and picked up my towel several times in terrifying indecision before looking up to find the wave crashing over me.  And then I woke up.  I never have to dream through the aftermath of being swept away in a tsunami, but I always feel the crushing realization that I have waited too long to make my decision and there is no getting away from the wave now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you may have guessed, the tsunami dream always occurs when I’m feeling overwhelmed in life, and the decision corresponds terrifyingly with whatever is overwhelming me.  For example, when I first became sick with gastrparesis, before I was diagnosed, I babysat frequently for multiple families.  I love kids and I especially loved the kids I was sitting for at that time.  As I got sicker, I started falling behind the kids in energy and patience and became unable to continue sitting for most of my kids.  There was one family that I wouldn’t let go of though, because the boy had special needs and his sister was amazing and their entire family treated me like I was part of the family.  But I kept getting sicker and sicker without a diagnosis and the boy was quickly becoming too much for me to handle physically.  So, without warning, the tsunami dream resolved the situation by placing me on that familiar beach and placed the boy and his sister at opposite ends of the beach.  Which one do I save before the tsunami kills us all?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As usual, I couldn’t make that decision.  I woke up from that dream crying and quit babysitting for good the next day.  Not because I ever thought I would have to make that decision, but because I realized I wasn’t doing either of those children any good continuing to babysit them in the condition I was in.  In fact, I’m not going to be able to do any children any good in with the disease I have.  And even though I didn’t know at the time that I had a lifelong ailment, I knew I had to stop trying to help my kids until I figured out how to help myself.  And I didn’t have that thought until the tsunami dream made me face the facts about the situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All that example is to say, I have a new recurring nightmare to contemplate and I haven’t figured out what it’s trying to affect.  I started having it when I moved away to Berkeley and it kind of pops up at random.  I had it last night, which is why I’m thinking about it today.  I’ve decided to call it “The Hallway Dream”.  In this dream, predictably, I’m always wandering through a series of hallways.  In the dream, I recognize the hallways as part of my childhood home.  They aren’t, and are never the same from dream to dream, but in the dream I am home.  But there’s something wrong, and dream me can never figure out what it is.  It’s like that scary movie tactic where they slightly skew the camera to unsettle the viewer without the viewer noticing.  The hallways aren’t skewed, but my dream self is slightly unsettled by something she’s seeing in the, to her, familiar hallways.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This nightmare is a weird one to me, because it’s not actually scary.  Thinking about it now, I’m just wandering some seemingly normal hallways.  There are doors, there are pictures and other things hung on the walls, and there’s light enough to see clearly.  But you notice I still call it a nightmare, because I am scared in the dream.  There’s something wrong and my dream persona doesn’t know what it is.  And because I haven’t figured what triggers this dream, I can’t really figure what’s wrong when I’m awake either.  I had it three or four times while I was in Berkeley, I had it once when I was living with my parents after I graduated, and now I’ve had it twice since living with Skoddie.  And I think I’ll continue having it until I figure out what it means.</p>

<p>I’ve always had a strange connection with my dreams.  Until very recently, I dreamed exclusively in nightmares.  At the same time, I almost never remember my dreams.  I knew they were nightmares because I woke up terrified, shaking, and sometimes too scared to look out from my covers to examine my room for a physical manifestation of whatever had just invaded my subconscious.  I was easily scared as a child, and because I didn’t remember my dreams, I never knew what was coming to get me.  I usually remembered a rush of noise, flashes of brightly lit and somehow unsettling colors, but nothing concrete.  Therefore, any misshapen shadow or unexplained noise could be perceived as something unknown creeping out of my nightmares into the living world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Those are the first type of dreams I had and I still have them today and still consider them nightmares.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second type of nightmare is the recurring ones.  These ones are everything the abstract nightmares aren’t.  They are clear, the danger is easily identifiable, and when I wake up I remember them vividly.  The difference is these ones are about things I’m actually afraid of in the living world, and so I don’t wake up terrified because they can’t get into my room.  They aren’t the unknown, they aren’t illogical and hard to describe.  In fact, according to most people, they aren’t even nightmare worthy.  I’ll eventually describe a couple to you and you can decide if that last bit is true or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve also always believed these recurring nightmares serve a purpose.  They aren’t always the exact same dream, but they’re variations on the original, and they happen at particular times in my life.  Like I said earlier, I feel weird about my dreams.  The abstract, immaterial ones scare the crap out of me, but I always eventually fall back asleep and they don’t affect me the next day at all.  The recurring ones wake me up and keep me awake thinking about them.  They affect my mindset about certain things, and they’ve even caused me to make life-altering decisions.  So they are important to me and when I have them I take them seriously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the same time, I don’t believe in the mystical version of dream reading.  I don’t believe my dreams will tell my fortune or hold mystical truths about myself.  At the same time, my recurring nightmares are not “just dreams”.  They’re truths of a certain variety, maybe just in a form my mind can understand better when I’m sleeping.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most popular recurring nightmare is something I call “The Tsunami Dream”.  I call it most popular because it happens the most often of all my recurring dreams.  In its original form, I’m standing on a beach, sometimes alone and sometimes with other people.  The first time I had it the beach was a familiar one, but it isn’t always.  In all versions of the dream, there is a beach and a cliff lining it.  This type of beach occurs in my hometown, but they’re common enough other places that you might know what I’m talking about.  Basically, there’s ocean, then sand, then a cliff, then the rest of the city or whatever.  That part is fuzzy in my dream because I never get there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, I’m standing on a beach and there’s a cliff at my back and the ocean in front of me.  And in the ocean, coming towards me, is one of those towering movie tsunamis than don’t actually occur many places in real life and certainly don’t occur where I live.  You know those giant walls of water that defy gravity and ocean physics and every other law of the land?  It’s always one of those.  And there’s always a choice I have to make before the tsunami reaches me, and I can never make the choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first time I had the dream I was fairly young, and the choice was do I gather my towel and stuff before I run away or not.  I remember this iteration of the dream vividly because I woke up feeling really stupid for having dreamed it.  But in the nightmare, I picked up, dropped, and picked up my towel several times in terrifying indecision before looking up to find the wave crashing over me.  And then I woke up.  I never have to dream through the aftermath of being swept away in a tsunami, but I always feel the crushing realization that I have waited too long to make my decision and there is no getting away from the wave now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you may have guessed, the tsunami dream always occurs when I’m feeling overwhelmed in life, and the decision corresponds terrifyingly with whatever is overwhelming me.  For example, when I first became sick with gastrparesis, before I was diagnosed, I babysat frequently for multiple families.  I love kids and I especially loved the kids I was sitting for at that time.  As I got sicker, I started falling behind the kids in energy and patience and became unable to continue sitting for most of my kids.  There was one family that I wouldn’t let go of though, because the boy had special needs and his sister was amazing and their entire family treated me like I was part of the family.  But I kept getting sicker and sicker without a diagnosis and the boy was quickly becoming too much for me to handle physically.  So, without warning, the tsunami dream resolved the situation by placing me on that familiar beach and placed the boy and his sister at opposite ends of the beach.  Which one do I save before the tsunami kills us all?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As usual, I couldn’t make that decision.  I woke up from that dream crying and quit babysitting for good the next day.  Not because I ever thought I would have to make that decision, but because I realized I wasn’t doing either of those children any good continuing to babysit them in the condition I was in.  In fact, I’m not going to be able to do any children any good in with the disease I have.  And even though I didn’t know at the time that I had a lifelong ailment, I knew I had to stop trying to help my kids until I figured out how to help myself.  And I didn’t have that thought until the tsunami dream made me face the facts about the situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All that example is to say, I have a new recurring nightmare to contemplate and I haven’t figured out what it’s trying to affect.  I started having it when I moved away to Berkeley and it kind of pops up at random.  I had it last night, which is why I’m thinking about it today.  I’ve decided to call it “The Hallway Dream”.  In this dream, predictably, I’m always wandering through a series of hallways.  In the dream, I recognize the hallways as part of my childhood home.  They aren’t, and are never the same from dream to dream, but in the dream I am home.  But there’s something wrong, and dream me can never figure out what it is.  It’s like that scary movie tactic where they slightly skew the camera to unsettle the viewer without the viewer noticing.  The hallways aren’t skewed, but my dream self is slightly unsettled by something she’s seeing in the, to her, familiar hallways.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This nightmare is a weird one to me, because it’s not actually scary.  Thinking about it now, I’m just wandering some seemingly normal hallways.  There are doors, there are pictures and other things hung on the walls, and there’s light enough to see clearly.  But you notice I still call it a nightmare, because I am scared in the dream.  There’s something wrong and my dream persona doesn’t know what it is.  And because I haven’t figured what triggers this dream, I can’t really figure what’s wrong when I’m awake either.  I had it three or four times while I was in Berkeley, I had it once when I was living with my parents after I graduated, and now I’ve had it twice since living with Skoddie.  And I think I’ll continue having it until I figure out what it means.</p>

<p>I visited a therapist for the first time last week and had a good conversation about my illness and my mental state.  I’ve known for a long time now that grief is part of the process of chronic illness and acceptance of the illness is necessary to continue living a healthy life after diagnosis.  I’ve known this and I’ve fought it because I don’t want to accept gastroparesis into my life and I don’t want to be ok with it.  But that refusal is tearing me apart mentally, so I went to the therapist as the first step towards acceptance.  She thinks she can help me, which makes one of us, and I think I’m at least willing to try.  Her first instruction was to write a letter to my gastroparesis making use of a prompt she gave me to get started in the right direction.  The following is the letter I’ve written, which I will read to my therapist when I see her on Wednesday:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dear Gastroparesis,</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don’t like you.  I don’t like being forced to second guess every ingredient in a meal before I eat it.  I used to be willing to try anything once.  I used to enjoy walking into a restaurant and ordering the weird thing on the menu I’d never heard of.  And no matter what came out on my plate, I would eat it, and I would usually enjoy it.  I don’t like having to special order meals, I don’t like having to read every ingredient on the box before I buy food at the store, and I especially don’t like the uncertainty you cause when all this fails and I get sick anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I resent you.  I resent having to give up my favorite foods and drinks because of you.  I will never get to order a large iced vanilla latte with extra cream because of you.  I will never taste the flavors of the world because of you.  I resent having to give up my favorite activities because of you.  I resent having to give up on my years of babysitting and childcare dreams because of you.  You exhaust me.  You weaken me.  You make me constantly sick.  I will never dance again because of you and for that, I resent you.  I resent the damage you have done to my body and my mind.  I resent you for forcing me to watch myself shrink until I had no weight left to lose and I resent you for the uphill battle to gain it all back.  And at the end of that battle, you have left me with crippling depression, anxiety, self-doubt, self-consciousness, a weak body image, and no hope of ever being the same and I resent you for all of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I hate you.  I hate when you make me feel sick.  Physically and mentally, you make me feel sick and I hate it.  I hate that you make everything worse.  I caught a cold and you turned it into strep, and then you made the antibiotics impossible to stomach.  I heard about a flu outbreak on campus and you made me believe I had caught it and was going to die from it.  I’ve had colds last for weeks because of what you’ve done to my body.  I hate that you ruined college for me.  I hate that my friends were all out partying while I stayed home and tried to fight you off.  I hate the word idiopathic, and I hate the hopelessness it inspires in me every time I think it.  I hate that it took my doctors years to name you, and even now that I know your name, I have no chance of ever defeating you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’m fed up with you.  I’m fed up with your rules.  Every time I think I’ve found something safe you ruin it.  Every meal, there’s something wrong.  Every drink, I have to question it.  Is it too much spice?  Is it too much caffeine?  Too acidic?  Too much fiber?  Oh by the way, I still have to get my daily vitamins, and even those you ruin with your rules.  It’s too much or it’s too little or I’ve forgotten I can’t actually eat that because your rules say no.  All of your rules add up to no and I am fed up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’m tired of you.  I’m tired of going to sleep nauseous and waking up nauseous and being nauseous every moment in between and knowing it will be that way for the rest of my life.  You are so well known for the nausea and even vomiting doesn’t make it go away, it makes it worse.  It triggers the pains and the anxiety and the tears.  I’m tired of the abdominal pains, and I’m tired of not knowing what’s causing them or how to fix them.  Every twinge brings new doubts and fears.  What’s wrong with me now?  Oh it’s just you, back again to remind me my body isn’t my own anymore.  I’m tired of the anxiety after every meal.  Will I keep my food down this time?  Will I need to take more pills to keep you at bay?  And the pills, oh the pills.  Every one making me tired or dizzy or causing pain and they’re all because of you and I am tired of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You make me sad all the time.  You are relentless and unforgiving and you make everything harder.  I have to plan out every second of my day including how and when I’m going to eat and it makes me sad.  Certain smells set you off, like the dogs at Claire’s house or the cat litter in the garage, and it’s not every time I smell them, it’s just certain times and then I have to leave.  I have to leave my friend’s house before you get too painful to deal with and it makes me sad.  Sometimes I have to not go at all because I know you’re in a mood and it makes me even more sad.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I feel awful all the time.  Physically and mentally, I feel awful.  I can’t enjoy games anymore because you make me tired and sick after a couple of hours.  I end up hiding in a corner with my phone at parties, counting down the time until everyone will leave or until I can leave and it feels awful.  It feels like I’m letting my friends down.  It feels like I’m letting my wife down.  And at the end of the day, all I can do is lay down and sleep and hope tomorrow will be better.  There is no solution except taking pills that make me feel awful and eating food that tastes awful or not eating at all which carries its own version of awful feelings.  I hate my body and it feels awful.  I hate my mind and it feels awful.  And I hate life and it feels awful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am disappointed with what my life has become.  I had plans before you.  I had dreams.  Those plans didn’t include monthly visits to my doctor or a psychiatrist or even a therapist.  I am disappointed because I can’t go do the things I wanted to do.  I can’t go back to school because I can’t physically handle the stress anymore but I also don’t know if I can get a job because that brings its own stress and I am so disappointed.  I can’t be a teacher because my body isn’t strong enough, I can’t be an author because my mind is fogged, and I can’t get my life together because there is so much about you that I don’t know and every time I try to learn I am disappointed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of all, I am afraid.  I am afraid that my health is only getting worse.  I am afraid that I can’t find a way to control my body.  I am afraid of how I feel when I fail to take you into account.  I am afraid of what you mean for my future.  I am afraid of all the questions you bring into my life.  Can I hold a steady job?  Can I still have children?  Can I ever go back to school?  Can I find a way to live with my new reality?  I am afraid of your questions, I am afraid you will say no, and I am afraid of what happens after.  What happens after you say no?  Most of all, I am afraid of what you mean for my future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I want my life and my body back.  I used to be so very happy in my skin.  I used to feel confident and beautiful and powerful.  I used to love being.  I used to daydream about a beautiful life and a beautiful family.  I want that back.  I want my confidence back.  I want to be able to look at my body in the mirror and smile.  I want balance back in my life.  I want to eat food without fear.  I want control over my weight and my health.  I want to feel joy that isn’t interrupted by worrying about my stomach.  I want to love myself again.  I want to love being again.</p>

<p>This is probably going to get into touchy territory for some people, but it’s something I need to get out.  So read my tags and if you can’t handle those topics, feel free not to read.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve been at war with my body for the better part of the last two years.  I mean mentally, physically, in all sense of the phrase, I am at war.  I hate my body.  I hate everything about it.  I hate everything it is doing.  I hate everything I have to deal with because of it.  And I hate myself for hating my body because I used to love it so much.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The day I got sick I weighed 165 pounds.  It was my fourth semester of taking ballet classes and my second semester of Pilates at my college and the women who taught the classes made every second worth it, which meant I was in great shape.  I don’t mean six-pack having, weight–lifting shape.  I mean I felt great.  I felt comfortable in my body.  I wasn’t model thin but I felt like I looked good.  I was happy.  Everything was in balance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The day I got sick my body betrayed me.  As far as anyone can tell me, my stomach just up and quit its job.  It took two years of testing and poking and prodding to prove to me that there was nothing wrong with me other than my stomach just didn’t work anymore.  No one I’ve seen has any clue why.  It was a slow transformation in my mind, but I went from loving everything about the body I was in, to hating every inch of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I started out by trying to placate my new condition.  I’ve been following the diet as far as I could find on forums and support groups online.  I cut almost all of my favorite foods out of my diet, I spent a lot of time trying to decide which vitamin supplements would help and which would harm, I stuck to a fairly strict rice-based diet.  Easy to digest, soft foods, liquids frequently.  I tried everything.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But even though I knew exactly what was wrong with me and what I was supposed to do to help make it better, almost nothing worked.  I’m on one of the most dangerous drugs on the market to help stimulate the muscles of my digestive system, I’m on the blandest diet possible, I eat smaller meals less frequently, and I’m still nauseous.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am nauseous all the time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And at some point, I decided I was fucking done with it.  My body, which I had loved and cared for as much as possible, continued to betray me.  I continued to lose weight, I sunk further into depression, I went mildly insane, my hands shook, my vision fogged, I developed migraines and headaches, and I deteriorated and deteriorated.  I hated it.  My body has betrayed me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And so I went to war.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve gone back and forth in my mind on whether or not I have an eating disorder or if I’m just suicidal.  The short of it is that it’s easier to just not eat.  I don’t usually wake up nauseous, it’s just when I add food, so some days I don’t.  Because then my body can’t let me down.  My stomach can’t fail me if I don’t put anything in it.  And it’s not fear of the nausea, it’s rage.  It’s anger and resentment that I have to deal with this bullshit everyday without relief.  I don’t get a break.  There are some days I only eat due to Skoddie’s prodding.  Some days I eat because I feel bad about what I’m doing to myself.  Some days I just don’t eat.  But at the same time, I’m not going to starve to death.  I&#8217;m actually gaining weight somehow.  So am I developing an eating disorder or am I suicidal?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Or am I just angry?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My therapist thinks I’m grieving.  She thinks I can move past the anger and her first instruction was to write a letter to my gastroparesis explaining what I hate/resent about it.  But I don’t know if I can separate the two.  Do I write to my gastroparesis or do I write to my stomach directly?  Do I ask it why it just decided to stop working one day without warning or reason?  Do I ask it if I did something to trigger this?  It’s an argument I’ve been having in my mind since I was diagnosed.  It’s an anger I’ve had since I heard the word “idiopathic” attached to my illness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’m not sure if this post makes sense in the way I wanted it to.  But this is what I mean when I say I hate my body.  I hate what it’s doing to me.  I hate what it’s turned into.  It’s not about weight, or shape, or color.  It’s about the betrayal I feel deep inside when I think about what I could have been if I didn’t wake up nauseous that day in 2013.</p>

<p>This is probably going to get into touchy territory for some people, but it’s something I need to get out.  So read my tags and if you can’t handle those topics, feel free not to read.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve been at war with my body for the better part of the last two years.  I mean mentally, physically, in all sense of the phrase, I am at war.  I hate my body.  I hate everything about it.  I hate everything it is doing.  I hate everything I have to deal with because of it.  And I hate myself for hating my body because I used to love it so much.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The day I got sick I weighed 165 pounds.  It was my fourth semester of taking ballet classes and my second semester of Pilates at my college and the women who taught the classes made every second worth it, which meant I was in great shape.  I don’t mean six-pack having, weight–lifting shape.  I mean I felt great.  I felt comfortable in my body.  I wasn’t model thin but I felt like I looked good.  I was happy.  Everything was in balance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The day I got sick my body betrayed me.  As far as anyone can tell me, my stomach just up and quit its job.  It took two years of testing and poking and prodding to prove to me that there was nothing wrong with me other than my stomach just didn’t work anymore.  No one I’ve seen has any clue why.  It was a slow transformation in my mind, but I went from loving everything about the body I was in, to hating every inch of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I started out by trying to placate my new condition.  I’ve been following the diet as far as I could find on forums and support groups online.  I cut almost all of my favorite foods out of my diet, I spent a lot of time trying to decide which vitamin supplements would help and which would harm, I stuck to a fairly strict rice-based diet.  Easy to digest, soft foods, liquids frequently.  I tried everything.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But even though I knew exactly what was wrong with me and what I was supposed to do to help make it better, almost nothing worked.  I’m on one of the most dangerous drugs on the market to help stimulate the muscles of my digestive system, I’m on the blandest diet possible, I eat smaller meals less frequently, and I’m still nauseous.</p>

<p>Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance.  These are what are known as the Five Stages of Grief, or the Five Stages of Dying depending on the situation and who you are talking to.  Basically, people who have lost or are going to lose a loved one are thought to go through these stages of emotion as they process the loss.  According to some psychologists and doctors, these stages are also relevant to people who find out they are dying, or are diagnosed with a life-changing illness or injury.  People who are paralyzed, people who have terminal cancer, people who lose a limb, the list is endless.  Many of these types of people are thought to go through this process of mourning the life they had before their particular disability or illness changed it.  It is thought to be the most healthy and common progression.  A person may not go through all the stages, and may even regress to a previous one after moving forward, but this progression is generally accepted as the norm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have been placed squarely in the anger category, though I experience bouts of depression augmented by my actual depression.  My denial phase was mostly spent in search of a cause of my illness.  I was in denial that this was a lifelong affliction, and I was in denial that I would never be able to go back to the way I was before.  I thought, if only I could find the cause, the doctors could fix it, my gastroparesis would go away, and everything would be great again.  I daydreamed about celebrating over double bacon cheeseburgers and root beer floats.  Even when two different specialists in two different cities told me idiopathic meant forever, I fought it.  I requested extra tests.  I spent days researching potential causes and comparing them to my symptoms.  I because very good friends with the librarians at my university.  I may have spent more time researching my disease than I did on work for my degree.  In the end the only knowledge I gained was that my life would never be the same again, and my dreams of living happily ever after had to be shelved with the rest of the fairy tales.  And that’s when I got angry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last night I attended the first annual Wastelander’s Ball.  This event is an off-shoot of a larger annual event called Wasteland Weekend.  Wasteland Weekend is a post-apocalyptic themed gathering based mostly around the Mad Max series, though it incorporates themes from other post-apoc stories as well.  It’s similar to a music festival like Coachella, except there are attractions other than music.  They set up a Thunderdome, there is a parade, there is food and bar areas, camping areas, and many apocalyptic themed groups and acts, all assembled in the middle of the desert in California for a few days.  I have known about Wasteland for a few years and have been interested in attending basically since I heard of it, but never knew if I would be able to handle such an event.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the Ball last night was a good chance to test out my endurance.  The theme was enforced, so you were to attend in your best post-apoc formal wear, many of the people who attend Wasteland Weekend were there, and some of the talent and music acts performed as well.  I spent a few days putting together a costume with the help of friends and attended the Ball with my wife.  I spent the weeks leading up to it thinking it wouldn’t be too strenuous, I would meet some of the people from Wasteland, and see if I wanted to actually attend the festival.  But about halfway through the night, my stomach began to hurt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the symptoms of gastroparesis is abdominal pains and bloating, something I can usually avoid by eating the proper foods and not working too hard.  But there is a special kind of pain I have begun to associate with over-exertion which I haven’t figured out how to avoid and can only be resolved by a full night of sleep.  It’s a sharp burning pain right below my sternum which, if unchecked, radiates throughout my abdomen.  Oddly, it is one of the few pains I experience which is not accompanied by nausea, but the pain can reach a 5 or 6 on the 10 point pain scale if I let it go long enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the kind of pain that assaulted me last night halfway through the Ball, and, at that point, I began to get angry and depressed.  I associate this pain with the ballet classes I took in college, walking too fast or far while Frisbee golfing, and the rare times I have attempted to really exercise since the onset of my illness.  I don’t associate it with sedately walking around a small restaurant in comfortable shoes and frequently taking breaks to meet and talk to people.  Which is why it made me angry.  I still have a little bit of that petulant child in me, that little voice in the back of my head that says, “but that’s not fair!”  I did everything right yesterday.  I ate simple and small meals like I’m supposed to, I made sure my costume wasn’t restricting or too heavy, I drank plenty of water, and I was still awarded with this burning pain.  The signal that my body was done with whatever I was doing, even if I wasn’t.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the rage stems from a few places.  It’s rage against my new restrictions, things my body is deciding without reason or warning.  I avoided creating a costume that cinched in around the middle, a style I find much more attractive than what I ended up wearing, because I knew putting physical pressure on my abdomen would upset my stomach.  I don’t get to wear corsetry anymore.  I avoided solid foods and large meals because I know eating too much would put pressure on my digestive system.  I couldn’t eat the food provided at the venue, I had to eat beforehand, and I had to eat something bland and soupy.  I couldn’t wear heels, my preferred shoe for a formal event, because I wanted my body to be comfortable and secure.  And even with all these precautions, I couldn’t do the one thing I wanted to do at the Ball.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I couldn’t dance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By the time the music started and everyone was on the dance floor, I was huddled in a corner wishing I could just rip my stomach out and toss it to the birds.  I can’t attend an event like the Wastelander’s Ball and participate in the main attraction.  I probably can’t go to Wasteland Weekend for the same reason.  Even with all my precautions and medications and doctors, I can’t go have fun with everyone else.  I can only sit on the sidelines and watch the party.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And that is what the rest of my life looks like</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And that is why I am stuck at Anger.</p>

<p>I went to my new doctor yesterday.  I was forced to switch after graduating, moving back to my hometown, getting married, and switching to a new insurance company.  This whole thing with my stomach started in 2013 and since then, I’ve switched doctors and specialists at least 15 times.  Over the course of those transfers I’ve been accused of a lot of things.  I’ve had doctors tell me I’m anorexic.  I’ve had doctors accuse me of seeking drugs.  I’ve had doctors call me alcoholic and irresponsible and not worthy of their care.  So I approached this new doctor with trepidation and the thought process that I need to be prepared.  I showed up 20 minutes early with copies of my most recent blood work, gastric empting study, endoscope, and a cheat sheet of all my medications, dosages, and past doctor’s offices and contact information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And she was the nicest, most sympathetic doctor I’ve ever spoken to.  She admitted she’d never had a patient with idiopathic gastroparesis so young and therefore wanted to hear my whole story from beginning to end.  I told her everything, I showed her my test results and paperwork, and answered her follow-up questions to the best of my ability.  And at some point I must have said or done something light-hearted because she commented on how well-adjusted and accepting of my illness I seem and how impressed she was by it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In reality, I’m not any of those things and I tend to get really confused when people think I am.  The truth is, I spend most of my days oscillating between rage and apathy so deep I can’t get out of bed.  And the rage is easier for me to deal with.  The rage gives me something to work with.  When I’m mad I can say no fuck this and get myself going until I get too mad and then I shut down into apathy for a while.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’m going to outline the thought process behind that rage/apathy spiral via an example.  Before I got sick, I was introduced to the magical gift of food that is called pho.  Really, all Vietnamese food, but for the purposes of this rant I’m specifying pho and Thai iced tea, which is some kind of black tea with cream in it and is basically the best drink I’ve ever put in my mouth.  When combined with a nice bowl of pho, it is the meal of gods and I ate it almost every day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, pho is basically just rice noodles in beef broth, sometimes with different cuts of meat and veggies added.  It is worth saying that I can, and still do, eat it very often.  But once I started getting sick I noticed a correlation with highly caffeinated drinks and my nausea and stopped drinking caffeine.  Once I was diagnosed, I learned it’s actually a specific type of acid in caffeinated drinks like coffee and tea that upsets my already sensitive stomach and causes nausea.  It’s not actually affecting the emptying of my stomach, it’s just irritating my system enough to cause nausea.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Skip to now, somewhere between four and five years after the onset of symptoms and about two years after the diagnosis of my gastroparesis, I decided to experiment with caffeine again.  My thought process was, before, the acid was irritating my already irritated stomach and digestive system.  Now, I’m on all kinds of medication and I wanted to see if I could handle these acidic caffeinated teas.  I started slow with green tea mixed with ginger tea, then plain green tea, and both seemed to go down just fine.  So, in my over confident and eternally optimistic mind, I decided to attempt my very favorite food and tea combo the next time I went for pho.  This happened this week on Tuesday, and then again tonight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Tuesday, all went moderately well.  My stomach was a little upset, but it’s honestly been worse and I figured if that was all I had to deal with in order to drink my very favorite drink in the world, I would live.  Tonight, I hardly made it out of the restaurant before I was hit with burning stomach pains and the overwhelming urge to vomit up everything I had just eaten and drank, including my tea.  I ended up taking three different medications, two of which are for emergencies only, in order to keep my food down and make it home.  And somewhere over the course of driving home, I got pissed off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I used to love food and eating.  Trying different kinds of food was my favorite thing in the world.  I was by no means a foodie, but I would basically try anything once.  I had a friend who would take me to all her random food spots and we’d eat all kinds of random shit together and those were honestly my favorite days.  I used to spend all my money on random food.  I would go over to other people’s houses and eat their random homemade food and love my life.  It was great.  Food is the best part of life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So imagine my fucking rage when I was diagnosed with an illness that basically limited my food options to the blandest, most easy to digest, most boring meals in the world.  For the rest of my life.  I have been mad for years, and nothing anyone says or does makes me less so.  I realize that being angry at God, the queen, and everyone in between is not going to fix anything but that’s where the apathy comes in.  I get so mad I could jump off a bridge and my only thought on the way down would be “Thank God I don’t have to take another fucking pill for the rest of my life”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I literally shut down.  I got so mad the other night, at a matter unrelated to my Thai tea dilemma, that I sat on the couch with a blanket over my head and fumed for hours.  I had to have a blanket over my head because I’ll pretty much get mad enough that seeing or interacting with anything else will set me into an extremely violent and toxic rage spiral.  I try to avoid it.  I’m staving that off right now by writing this post and watching nail polish tutorials.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am that level of enraged by the realization that I can probably never drink Thai tea ever again for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>And a lot of people will surely say this is counter-productive to my mental health and the acceptance process.  In fact, people have already told me this.  There’s a mourning process you go through when diagnosed with an illness like this and anger is just one step in the process.  You eventually have to come to terms and move on and not be constantly mad at life, this is immature, etc.  And maybe I’ll reach that point of acceptance and maturity at some point in my life.  But for now, I stand in defense of my rage.</p>

<p>I went to my new doctor yesterday.  I was forced to switch after graduating, moving back to my hometown, getting married, and switching to a new insurance company.  This whole thing with my stomach started in 2013 and since then, I’ve switched doctors and specialists at least 15 times.  Over the course of those transfers I’ve been accused of a lot of things.  I’ve had doctors tell me I’m anorexic.  I’ve had doctors accuse me of seeking drugs.  I’ve had doctors call me alcoholic and irresponsible and not worthy of their care.  So I approached this new doctor with trepidation and the thought process that I need to be prepared.  I showed up 20 minutes early with copies of my most recent blood work, gastric empting study, endoscope, and a cheat sheet of all my medications, dosages, and past doctor’s offices and contact information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And she was the nicest, most sympathetic doctor I’ve ever spoken to.  She admitted she’d never had a patient with idiopathic gastroparesis so young and therefore wanted to hear my whole story from beginning to end.  I told her everything, I showed her my test results and paperwork, and answered her follow-up questions to the best of my ability.  And at some point I must have said or done something light-hearted because she commented on how well-adjusted and accepting of my illness I seem and how impressed she was by it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In reality, I’m not any of those things and I tend to get really confused when people think I am.  The truth is, I spend most of my days oscillating between rage and apathy so deep I can’t get out of bed.  And the rage is easier for me to deal with.  The rage gives me something to work with.  When I’m mad I can say no fuck this and get myself going until I get too mad and then I shut down into apathy for a while.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’m going to outline the thought process behind that rage/apathy spiral via an example.  Before I got sick, I was introduced to the magical gift of food that is called pho.  Really, all Vietnamese food, but for the purposes of this rant I’m specifying pho and Thai iced tea, which is some kind of black tea with cream in it and is basically the best drink I’ve ever put in my mouth.  When combined with a nice bowl of pho, it is the meal of gods and I ate it almost every day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, pho is basically just rice noodles in beef broth, sometimes with different cuts of meat and veggies added.  It is worth saying that I can, and still do, eat it very often.  But once I started getting sick I noticed a correlation with highly caffeinated drinks and my nausea and stopped drinking caffeine.  Once I was diagnosed, I learned it’s actually a specific type of acid in caffeinated drinks like coffee and tea that upsets my already sensitive stomach and causes nausea.  It’s not actually affecting the emptying of my stomach, it’s just irritating my system enough to cause nausea.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Skip to now, somewhere between four and five years after the onset of symptoms and about two years after the diagnosis of my gastroparesis, I decided to experiment with caffeine again.  My thought process was, before, the acid was irritating my already irritated stomach and digestive system.  Now, I’m on all kinds of medication and I wanted to see if I could handle these acidic caffeinated teas.  I started slow with green tea mixed with ginger tea, then plain green tea, and both seemed to go down just fine.  So, in my over confident and eternally optimistic mind, I decided to attempt my very favorite food and tea combo the next time I went for pho.  This happened this week on Tuesday, and then again tonight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Tuesday, all went moderately well.  My stomach was a little upset, but it’s honestly been worse and I figured if that was all I had to deal with in order to drink my very favorite drink in the world, I would live.  Tonight, I hardly made it out of the restaurant before I was hit with burning stomach pains and the overwhelming urge to vomit up everything I had just eaten and drank, including my tea.  I ended up taking three different medications, two of which are for emergencies only, in order to keep my food down and make it home.  And somewhere over the course of driving home, I got pissed off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I used to love food and eating.  Trying different kinds of food was my favorite thing in the world.  I was by no means a foodie, but I would basically try anything once.  I had a friend who would take me to all her random food spots and we’d eat all kinds of random shit together and those were honestly my favorite days.  I used to spend all my money on random food.  I would go over to other people’s houses and eat their random homemade food and love my life.  It was great.  Food is the best part of life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So imagine my fucking rage when I was diagnosed with an illness that basically limited my food options to the blandest, most easy to digest, most boring meals in the world.  For the rest of my life.  I have been mad for years, and nothing anyone says or does makes me less so.  I realize that being angry at God, the queen, and everyone in between is not going to fix anything but that’s where the apathy comes in.  I get so mad I could jump off a bridge and my only thought on the way down would be “Thank God I don’t have to take another fucking pill for the rest of my life”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I literally shut down.  I got so mad the other night, at a matter unrelated to my Thai tea dilemma, that I sat on the couch with a blanket over my head and fumed for hours.  I had to have a blanket over my head because I’ll pretty much get mad enough that seeing or interacting with anything else will set me into an extremely violent and toxic rage spiral.  I try to avoid it.  I’m staving that off right now by writing this post and watching nail polish tutorials.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am that level of enraged by the realization that I can probably never drink Thai tea ever again for the rest of my life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And a lot of people will surely say this is counter-productive to my mental health and the acceptance process.  In fact, people have already told me this.  There’s a mourning process you go through when diagnosed with an illness like this and anger is just one step in the process.  You eventually have to come to terms and move on and not be constantly mad at life, this is immature, etc.  And maybe I’ll reach that point of acceptance and maturity at some point in my life.  But for now, I stand in defense of my rage.</p>

<p>There’s this weird succession that occurs when you become sick and start losing weight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, there’s a lag while news spreads that you are ill.  During this time, well-meaning people begin congratulating you on your weight loss, thinking it was intentional and desired.  They believe, like so many others in society, that you were not happy with your body originally and that now you are fixing it.  So they congratulate you.  This phase lasted for about two months of my illness.  That was about the first 40 pounds of weight loss.  While I starved, friends and family came to me smiling and hugged me and said I looked great and good job on the weight loss.  The problem is, during this time period in the illness, I didn’t know how to tell them they were wrong.  I had no diagnosis, I had no answers, and I had multiple doctors accusing me of anorexia.  So I smiled and thanked them for the compliment and let the news spread naturally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, there’s the collective realization and mourning of your illness, followed by the commentary about how skinny you’ve become and the questions about how you’re going to manage your illness.  This phase of my illness lasted about a year and a half, when my weight dipped into double digits and those who saw me on a regular basis realized it wasn’t intentional and something was wrong.  During this period, I still didn’t have a diagnosis, I didn’t have a reliable way to stop the nausea or the weight loss, and I didn’t have a way to express to those around me that I really wished they would stop telling me how worried about me they were.  I can guarantee, I was way more worried than anyone else involved in the project, and the constant reminder that everyone in my life was basically watching me die wasn’t in anyway helpful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Third, if you are lucky, there’s the collective relief of a diagnosis and regaining the weight.  This phase is characterized by everyone in your life coming to tell you how happy they are that you’re getting better, how much healthier you look, and oh by the way have you tried X insane diet because my brother’s friend’s wife thinks it’s really good for you and you should try it.  This is the final phase and is currently ongoing.  This phase is characterized by long conversations with everyone who has been paying attention during the last two phases, educating them on the illness that is killing you, listening to their unsolicited medical advice with a smile on your face, and walking away feeling like shit about your body.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here’s the thing about me and my body image.  I never had a problem with my body or my weight or anything like that until I got sick.  A lot of adolescent girls go through a period of body hate and insecurity where they get really uncomfortable with their bodies and how they look.  We are socialized from a young age to believe we are too fat, too thin, too pimply, too pale, too dark, and any number of other “too much” things.  Everything is wrong with our bodies and the fashion and beauty industries offer us many expensive and time consuming solutions to these “too much” problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But I never believed them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I wasn’t ever a paragon of self-confidence, but I was always at least comfortable in my skin.  My issues were always internal.  I was more worried about whether or not people perceived me as a bitch than whether or not they thought I was fat.  I’m not placing myself above those girls who go through those problems at all though.  I just never understood the fascination with makeup and beauty products and never used them.  I was working on my personality instead.  So imagine my surprise when my entirely dependable and beautiful body revolted, transformed, and turned into an enemy.  My stomach no longer works.  I can count my ribs.  I literally almost starved to death before we finally figured out what was wrong with me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’m reading a book right now about the science of sex and arousal and the female body and I reached a part where the author relays a story about a recent mother who breaks down crying because she now has to figure out a way to love her body again after birth.  Her friends assure her she is beautiful, but she tells the author those reassurances made her feel worse about feeling bad about her body to begin with.  So maybe people who have given birth can relate to how I feel now that all my friends come running up to tell me how good I look now.  Maybe those who have suffered from eating disorders can understand.  Maybe other chronic illness sufferers can understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But if you’ve never suffered, there is no way for me to explain the deep and utter loathing I experience towards my body at this point in my life.  And part of that loathing came from the scrutiny I faced while my body was going through this transformation I never wanted.  It came from everyone telling me I looked lovely or healthy or too skinny or sick while my body internally revolted and decided to self-destruct without my permission.  I came from the juxtaposition of my hatred of my illness and society’s praises of my losses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like the pregnant woman in the book I’m reading, all I want is for everyone to stop reassuring me I look fine, and start telling me it’s ok to be angry at my body for changing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Society hammers us with messages that our bodies are not pretty enough and not smooth enough and them when we finally believe them, society says, “No, you’re fine, why would you think that?”  Our body hatred stems from society’s reactions to transformations and changes which are sometimes out of our control.  At the height of my weight loss, when I weighed 90 pounds, I would sit in my room counting my ribs and cry for hours.  And then I would leave my bubble of self hatred to be told I looked so skinny and good.  Or someone would ask if I was ok because I looked so ill.  And I would return to my bubble and count my ribs and play those comments over and over in my head, and I finally came to the realization that my body is wrong or was wrong and I’ve never been enough and that’s why everyone waited until I got sick to comment on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don’t have a solution to this problem, other than to ask people to stop commenting on each others’ weights and body changes.  But will that help?  Will that cure my self-hatred?  Will that make our little girls feel better about their acne?  Will it make our pregnant mothers ok with the changing landscape of their bodies?  I don’t think that’s all there is to it.  But, it’s sure a start.</p>

<p>A lot of my life revolves around my anxiety, and a lot of people don’t really understand what that means.  If you’ve never experienced an anxiety disorder, you don’t know what that means.  There’s a difference between stress and anxiety, and there’s a difference between momentary anxiety and the type a disorder causes.  That’s not to say one person’s anxiety is more or less valid than another’s.  They’re just different.  The daily anxiety I experience is different than the anxiety you experience when you failed to study for a test, which is different than the stress you feel while doing your math homework.  It’s possible to feel all of these types of anxiety at once and it’s possible to feel only one.  I’m just saying a lot of people don’t understand what a medically diagnosed anxiety disorder entails.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I named this blog, I didn’t just pull Fetzig out of thin air.  I named my anxiety a little over a year ago during a conversation with my fiancée.  I named her, I created a personality for her, and I set her aside in her own place in my mind.  It was important at that time for me to realize that Fetzig is a different entity entirely.  She is a part of me, but she is not me.  I had to figure out a way to keep her from defining my life.  Naming her and giving her a space to sit was how I dealt with the situation, and it’s been fairly successful so far.  I think of my daily anxiety as Fetzig, the overprotective, jumpy, nagging roommate who cosigned the lease on my brain.  And living with her isn’t easy, but it’s easier than having the official words General Anxiety Disorder looming over my life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I call Fetzig overprotective because she gets upset about things that she perceives to be threats to my physical and mental health.  I say she perceives the threats because these are things that I, the sane part of my psyche, know aren’t actually dangerous.  Things like soda and milkshake machines.  There are a lot of those articles going around the internet titled things like “Foods You Should Never Order at Fast Food Restaurants”.  They’re usually lists or click-bait pages that have originated from Redit threads where people talk about all the horrible things they’ve witnessed wherever they were working or eating.  Something that is always on those lists are soda dispensers and milkshake makers, because they can have horrible bacterial growths if not cleaned properly.  If you listen to the internet, and Fetzig, no one ever cleans those machines and you should never drink anything that comes out of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem with articles like that, other than them being extremely inaccruate, is that Fetzig latches onto them and never lets go.  And the problem with labeling milkshakes as dangerous is, believe it or not, they are on every diet list I’ve ever seen for Gastroparesis.  In moderation, they’re a really good source of easy to digest calories and calcium for someone with stomach problems if you can handle dairy.  Depending on what kind of stomach day I’m having, a milkshake is sometimes all I can manage for dinner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was a night about a month ago that I walked out of class, got into my car, and started contemplating what I would have for dinner as I drove home from school.  I was craving something substantive, but my stomach had been acting up that day so I didn’t want to eat anything too big or hard to digest.  I decided a milkshake and some fries from Jack in the Box would be the best thing for the conditions and rerouted to the nearest restaurant to grab dinner before I went to the house.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the way there, I started hearing Fetzig’s voice in my head.  What about that article you read the other day?  That guy said he worked at a popular fast food chain and they never cleaned their shake machine.  What if this Jack in the Box is the same?  You’re going to get sick.  You shouldn’t get the shake.  It’s not safe.  You shouldn&#8217;t even eat here.  How often do they change their fry oil?  You&#8217;ll never know.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I pulled into the parking lot arguing reason with myself.  I even got my Skoddie in on the matter.  I parked and started texting her while trying to convince myself that of course they clean their machines because health code restrictions.  Before long, Skoddie is trying to talk me out of a full blown anxiety attack via text in a Jack in the Box parking lot.  I don’t know if she remembered that conversation we had a year ago, but she was attempting to reason with Fetzig whether or not she realized it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I sat in my car for a good 15 minutes before Skoddie suggested I go looking for the restaurant’s health code certifications.  Where I’m from in Southern California, those ratings are prominently displayed as large colored letter grades in the windows of the eatery in question.  So, thinking this will surely calm my mind, I start walking around this little fast food place looking for something similar.  Seeing nothing on the outside windows, I spend a little time peering into the place looking for a grade posted inside.  No such luck, I return to my car with Fetzig in my brain triumphantly shouting.  See, there’s no certification grade.  This must not be a good place to eat.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’m in my car ready to never eat out again when Skoddie points out that grading system is regional.  In Berkeley, it might be different.  So once again, determined to prove to Fetzig that my milkshake is going to be drinkable, I go back to the windows and start looking for any kind of official looking documentation.  I don’t even think about going inside to ask.  Hello underpaid cashier, please humor my insanity by proving to me you and your coworkers comply with health codes and keep your milkshake machines cleaned properly.  No way.  Instead, I spend ten minutes peering through the windows like a weirdo until I finally spot some official looking documents posted next to the cash registers.  These turn out to be the proof of inspection papers I was seeking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As strange as it sounds, this wasn’t the end of Fetzig for the night.  I spend a few more minutes texting with Skoddie before I feel comfortable enough going through the drive-thru and ordering my dinner.  And even as I’m drinking my milkshake, I hear Fetzig’s voice in my head numbering all the symptoms of food poisoning.  And oddly similar list to my usual Gastroparesis symptoms.  I didn’t end up developing food poisoning, but even that wasn’t the end of Fetzig’s opinion on the matter.  Every time I return to that place to get a milkshake, she’s in my head telling me about that article we read and all the bad things that grow in sugary environments.  I heard her tonight when I went there for a milkshake and fries again.  She was easier to ignore today, but I still heard her.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But it’s hard to view Fetzig as a harmful part of my psyche.  Like I said, she’s just being way over protective.  Maybe someday she’ll keep me from actually getting sick.  I’m not sure she’s been useful in that regard so far, but I’ll never actually know.  She’s the voice that makes me wash the tops of my cans of soup before I open them even though the Mythbusters proved that myth highly unlikely.  Her voice is the one that made me afraid of caffeinated green tea for almost a year, and she continues to keep me from trying sushi even though all sources point to it being really good for you and easy to digest.  She’s the over-active conspiracy theorist living in a corner of my brain.  Her voice is really loud some days and a whisper others.  She’s really easy to ignore some days and harder to overcome others.  But her voice is always there.  She is always there.</p>
</div>

<p>A lot of my life revolves around my anxiety, and a lot of people don’t really understand what that means.  If you’ve never experienced an anxiety disorder, you don’t know what that means.  There’s a difference between stress and anxiety, and there’s a difference between momentary anxiety and the type a disorder causes.  That’s not to say one person’s anxiety is more or less valid than another’s.  They’re just different.  The daily anxiety I experience is different than the anxiety you experience when you failed to study for a test, which is different than the stress you feel while doing your math homework.  It’s possible to feel all of these types of anxiety at once and it’s possible to feel only one.  I’m just saying a lot of people don’t understand what a medically diagnosed anxiety disorder entails.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I named this blog, I didn’t just pull Fetzig out of thin air.  I named my anxiety a little over a year ago during a conversation with my fiancée.  I named her, I created a personality for her, and I set her aside in her own place in my mind.  It was important at that time for me to realize that Fetzig is a different entity entirely.  She is a part of me, but she is not me.  I had to figure out a way to keep her from defining my life.  Naming her and giving her a space to sit was how I dealt with the situation, and it’s been fairly successful so far.  I think of my daily anxiety as Fetzig, the overprotective, jumpy, nagging roommate who cosigned the lease on my brain.  And living with her isn’t easy, but it’s easier than having the official words General Anxiety Disorder looming over my life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I call Fetzig overprotective because she gets upset about things that she perceives to be threats to my physical and mental health.  I say she perceives the threats because these are things that I, the sane part of my psyche, know aren’t actually dangerous.  Things like soda and milkshake machines.  There are a lot of those articles going around the internet titled things like “Foods You Should Never Order at Fast Food Restaurants”.  They’re usually lists or click-bait pages that have originated from Redit threads where people talk about all the horrible things they’ve witnessed wherever they were working or eating.  Something that is always on those lists are soda dispensers and milkshake makers, because they can have horrible bacterial growths if not cleaned properly.  If you listen to the internet, and Fetzig, no one ever cleans those machines and you should never drink anything that comes out of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem with articles like that, other than them being extremely inaccruate, is that Fetzig latches onto them and never lets go.  And the problem with labeling milkshakes as dangerous is, believe it or not, they are on every diet list I’ve ever seen for Gastroparesis.  In moderation, they’re a really good source of easy to digest calories and calcium for someone with stomach problems if you can handle dairy.  Depending on what kind of stomach day I’m having, a milkshake is sometimes all I can manage for dinner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was a night about a month ago that I walked out of class, got into my car, and started contemplating what I would have for dinner as I drove home from school.  I was craving something substantive, but my stomach had been acting up that day so I didn’t want to eat anything too big or hard to digest.  I decided a milkshake and some fries from Jack in the Box would be the best thing for the conditions and rerouted to the nearest restaurant to grab dinner before I went to the house.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the way there, I started hearing Fetzig’s voice in my head.  What about that article you read the other day?  That guy said he worked at a popular fast food chain and they never cleaned their shake machine.  What if this Jack in the Box is the same?  You’re going to get sick.  You shouldn’t get the shake.  It’s not safe.  You shouldn&#8217;t even eat here.  How often do they change their fry oil?  You&#8217;ll never know.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I pulled into the parking lot arguing reason with myself.  I even got my Skoddie in on the matter.  I parked and started texting her while trying to convince myself that of course they clean their machines because health code restrictions.  Before long, Skoddie is trying to talk me out of a full blown anxiety attack via text in a Jack in the Box parking lot.  I don’t know if she remembered that conversation we had a year ago, but she was attempting to reason with Fetzig whether or not she realized it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I sat in my car for a good 15 minutes before Skoddie suggested I go looking for the restaurant’s health code certifications.  Where I’m from in Southern California, those ratings are prominently displayed as large colored letter grades in the windows of the eatery in question.  So, thinking this will surely calm my mind, I start walking around this little fast food place looking for something similar.  Seeing nothing on the outside windows, I spend a little time peering into the place looking for a grade posted inside.  No such luck, I return to my car with Fetzig in my brain triumphantly shouting.  See, there’s no certification grade.  This must not be a good place to eat.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’m in my car ready to never eat out again when Skoddie points out that grading system is regional.  In Berkeley, it might be different.  So once again, determined to prove to Fetzig that my milkshake is going to be drinkable, I go back to the windows and start looking for any kind of official looking documentation.  I don’t even think about going inside to ask.  Hello underpaid cashier, please humor my insanity by proving to me you and your coworkers comply with health codes and keep your milkshake machines cleaned properly.  No way.  Instead, I spend ten minutes peering through the windows like a weirdo until I finally spot some official looking documents posted next to the cash registers.  These turn out to be the proof of inspection papers I was seeking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As strange as it sounds, this wasn’t the end of Fetzig for the night.  I spend a few more minutes texting with Skoddie before I feel comfortable enough going through the drive-thru and ordering my dinner.  And even as I’m drinking my milkshake, I hear Fetzig’s voice in my head numbering all the symptoms of food poisoning.  And oddly similar list to my usual Gastroparesis symptoms.  I didn’t end up developing food poisoning, but even that wasn’t the end of Fetzig’s opinion on the matter.  Every time I return to that place to get a milkshake, she’s in my head telling me about that article we read and all the bad things that grow in sugary environments.  I heard her tonight when I went there for a milkshake and fries again.  She was easier to ignore today, but I still heard her.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But it’s hard to view Fetzig as a harmful part of my psyche.  Like I said, she’s just being way over protective.  Maybe someday she’ll keep me from actually getting sick.  I’m not sure she’s been useful in that regard so far, but I’ll never actually know.  She’s the voice that makes me wash the tops of my cans of soup before I open them even though the Mythbusters proved that myth highly unlikely.  Her voice is the one that made me afraid of caffeinated green tea for almost a year, and she continues to keep me from trying sushi even though all sources point to it being really good for you and easy to digest.  She’s the over-active conspiracy theorist living in a corner of my brain.  Her voice is really loud some days and a whisper others.  She’s really easy to ignore some days and harder to overcome others.  But her voice is always there.  She is always there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That is what it’s like living with an anxiety disorder.</p>

<p>When I first thought of starting a blog, I knew there was a possibility of it being a chronicle of my descent into insanity.  I know that sounds dramatic, but in all honesty there is a very real chance of me not coming out of this illness intact.  Whether it be physically or mentally, I am going to lose something.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’m thinking about this today because I haven’t been doing well mentally.  My depression has been steadily increasing for the last two weeks, and there’s not much I can do but attempt to ride it out.  I got a brief bit of lift over Thanksgiving with my fiancée, but as soon as she went home I dropped right back into my little pit.  I spent this past weekend staring at a blank word document, forcing myself to do research for a paper, and crying.  And today wasn’t much better.  The paper is due Wednesday at 9AM and instead I find myself compelled to attempt to put something into words I don’t really understand myself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This morning I woke up for class and I felt shaky.  In my head.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It doesn’t really make sense when I say it like that.  It felt like I was pulling apart at the seams.  I walked around the house making tea, eating breakfast and such, and the whole time I wondered if I was actually shaking.  I wasn’t, but I still drove to school with my arm wrapped around my stomach as if I could hold myself together that way.  I wasn’t any more nauseous than I usually am, and I wasn’t particularly tired.  I just wasn’t all there.  I sat in the car in the parking garage and just tried to breathe and steady myself.  I felt oddly calm otherwise.  There was no anxiety, no signs that I could see anything wrong.  I just couldn’t put myself back together.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eventually, I had to walk to class.  I checked every so often to make sure I wasn’t actually outwardly shaking.   I hugged my tea to my chest and avoided eye contact as much as possible.  At some point, I realized I was crying again.  I stopped in a bathroom to fix the issue as best as possible.  The alarmed look I received from another student there would have spoken volumes if I could understand what she saw in my appearance.  She cut across the hall to avoid walking near me.  I felt a little more unsteady.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But looking in the mirror before class, I couldn’t see what she saw.  Tears removed, I looked like a completely normal, although tired, college student.  Still, one of my friends in class took one look at me and was immediately concerned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“You look like you’ve had the soul sucked out of you.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My reflexive smile didn’t reach my eyes.  I could tell he wasn’t reassured.  I mumbled something about being tired and went back to avoiding eye contact.  As I sat in class and went through the motions, I felt like something I was doing betrayed my mental state.  My friend seemed to glance over at me more often than usual, my professor’s gaze seemed concerned, and I felt panic ticking closer every moment I sat there trying to listen to her lecture.  I don’t know if any of this was real.  I imagined my classmates watching me fall apart over and over in that hour of class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The drive home is what triggered it.  It takes 15 minutes to drive from Downtown Berkeley to the house I’m staying at.  That 15 minute drive turned into a nightmare of anxiety.  I had become hungry, my hands started shaking, and I began to imagine the jerking motions everyone on Reglan is told to look out for.  The world around me became blurry, the sounds deadened, and I started to sweat in 60 degree weather.  I was having the panic attack I had staved off during class on the road home.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being the completely logical and sane human being that I am, I kept driving.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I can’t tell you why my brain went to Dory from Finding Nemo in that moment.  Just keep swimming.  It’s happened once before.  I was driving home from a party, before I had gotten sick, and I suddenly realized I was way too drunk to be driving.  I wasn’t swerving, I wasn’t going off the road, and I wasn’t speeding.  A realization just broke over me.  I had no idea how any of that was happening.  I was wasted and terrified and on the freeway halfway home.  And my completely irresponsible response was to just keep going.  Just keep swimming.  The one and only time I drove drunk by the way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My panic response seems to be just keep going.  Pretend everything is normal until you make it to a safe space.  I’m apparently very good at it.  I fell apart on the drive home today.  I started crying, I got nauseous, I couldn’t breathe, and my mind just abandoned me.  Everything blurred together though I could see the road fine.  I took deep breaths and felt like I was suffocating.  My entire body began shaking but my hands somehow stayed steady.  I started to believe the world was falling apart around me.  I can’t begin to accurately describe it to you.  It felt like I was actually going insane.  I had a total meltdown on the drive home, pulled into a parking spot in front of my house, took a final deep breath, and it was over.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve spent the rest of today in bed contemplating that moment.  The moment it felt like I was literally losing my mind.  Coming apart at the seams is the only way I can describe it.  If you’ve ever seen someone take a piece of sewing and pull at the two pieces until the stitches holding them together gradually become visible, you know what I’m talking about.  Even the best made pieces come apart with enough pressure.  Sometimes the stitches are loose enough that the thread just pulls apart, and sometimes it just breaks.  But everything pulls apart with enough pressure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don’t really know why I feel compelled to share today’s story.  I usually feel like something can be gained from my struggles, but today just feels pointless.  Maybe I could have avoided the panic attack by not going to class.  Maybe it would have just been worse when it finally happened.  Even after some food and a short nap, I’m feeling unsteady.  My brain feels shaky.  My seams feel loose.  I have work to do if I want to graduate though.  I really identify with Dory on days like today.  Find the strength, find the will, and find a way.  Maybe the point is just keep swimming.</p>

<p>This post is going to offend some people.  This post is going to make some people uncomfortable.  If you experience either of those emotions, this post is for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the same time, this post is going to resonate with some people.  Maybe this post will even help some people.  This post is for you too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This semester has been a hard one.  It’s been hard mentally and emotionally. One of the things they didn’t tell me when they diagnosed me was that gastroparesis can have a serious effect on your mental health.  They didn’t tell me that my previous minor psychological problems could be multiplied.  They didn’t tell me that an imbalance in my hormonal centers could form.  They don’t tell you all this when they diagnose you with chronic illness because they don’t want it to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Unfortunately, that approach leaves those of us who develop those serious mental illnesses completely unprepared.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had some issues before I got sick.  I was bullied pretty hard when I was young, my family’s emotional support situation was not ideal, and I grew up with a lot of emotional baggage.  Had I made it to adulthood unscathed, maybe all I would have needed is a bit of therapy and a good support system to work through it.  On the other hand, maybe the depression was always in there anyway.  I’ll never know.  I do know that when I got physically sick, I got mentally sick as well.  And I was unprepared.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve spent most of today in bed thinking about the phrase “it gets better” and the campaigns and social movements surrounding it.  Most of these are aimed at depressed and suicidal individuals with the thought process that if only we believe hard enough for long enough, all of our problems will eventually get better.  Through hard work or divine intervention, it will get better.  Here’s the problem with that slogan.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>True or not, clinically depressed individuals cannot comprehend that statement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That campaign stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what depression actually is.  It works for moody teenagers and temporarily suicidal college students, because, for them, it truly will get better.  Failing a final will not ruin your entire life.  Breaking up with a partner hurts, but the resulting depression is temporary and will heal with the pain.  For a lot of people, it will get better if they wait long enough or try hard enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Someone with clinical depression suffers from a break down within the brain.  Certain nerves and glands misfire, certain hormones are not exchanged properly, or certain receptors just don’t work.  There’s a lot of science behind it, and honestly they don’t really understand it completely.  That’s why mental health patients often have to cycle through drugs and dosages before landing on the ones that work for them.  The short of it is depression is a physical failing that creates an uncontrollable mental and emotional imbalance.  And, often, it does not get better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Take mine for example.  A possibly preexisting imbalance that was triggered or worsened by the onset of a chronic physical illness.  I’ve had two psychologists confirm this is not just the moody blues.  I have developed full-blown clinical depression.  And, not matter how hard I pray or how many drugs I take, it will not go away.  Our current medical approach to depression is incurable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It will not get better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not only will it not get better, people telling me it will actually makes it worse.  It gets better means I didn’t try hard enough.  It gets better puts the fault on me.  It means that today, when I was unable to force myself to get out of bed, I was just being lazy.  I was the one who didn’t try hard enough.  I didn’t have the gumption to feed or dress myself.  I didn’t want to be ok bad enough.  That’s what you tell a clinically depressed person when you say “it gets better”.  That’s not what you meant?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It doesn’t matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Talking to a depressed person about the future is the greatest exercise in futility I have ever witnessed.  I don’t remember the past days when I was happy and care-free.  I know they existed.  I have pictures.  But I don’t remember those emotions.  Similarly, I can’t see a future in which I am happy again.  I don’t know how to feel that emotion anymore.  I can’t even visualize it right now as I’m writing about it.  My life is zeroed in on today and right now and how I’m feeling and what I’m doing right that moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And usually, how I’m feeling is numb.  I have spent the last few months of my life completely at war with my desire to lie in bed and never get up again.  Every morning I wake up and spend about 45 minutes convincing myself it’s worth it.  On days when my stomach is acting up, that time is extended.  And there have been a lot of days of failure.  I’ve missed classes.  I’ve ignored text messages and emails.  I’ve skipped meals.  I’ve spent days basking in the relentless meaninglessness of my own existence, knowing for a fact that nothing I do matters and I will eventually die so why not today.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And your gut reaction will be to tell me this isn’t true.  It’ll get better.  It’s happened already.  Friends telling me they love me and they’re here for me and they’ll talk when I need to.  Here’s the problem.  In those moments, I don’t want to talk to you.  Anything you say to me is meaningless.  Your love is meaningless.  Your love can even be harmful.  I am such a basket of pain and numbness and anxiey that your attempt to intervene can throw me out of a very delicate balance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Medications calm the chaos.  Medications allow me to get out of bed more days than I normally could.  But they don’t cure that feeling.  They make it all a little fuzzier and distant.  Numb in a good way.  It’s an angry numbness though.  It’s buzzing and itching.  It’s a skin that doesn’t exactly fit.

<p>This post is going to offend some people.  This post is going to make some people uncomfortable.  If you experience either of those emotions, this post is for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the same time, this post is going to resonate with some people.  Maybe this post will even help some people.  This post is for you too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This semester has been a hard one.  It’s been hard mentally and emotionally. One of the things they didn’t tell me when they diagnosed me was that gastroparesis can have a serious effect on your mental health.  They didn’t tell me that my previous minor psychological problems could be multiplied.  They didn’t tell me that an imbalance in my hormonal centers could form.  They don’t tell you all this when they diagnose you with chronic illness because they don’t want it to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Unfortunately, that approach leaves those of us who develop those serious mental illnesses completely unprepared.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had some issues before I got sick.  I was bullied pretty hard when I was young, my family’s emotional support situation was not ideal, and I grew up with a lot of emotional baggage.  Had I made it to adulthood unscathed, maybe all I would have needed is a bit of therapy and a good support system to work through it.  On the other hand, maybe the depression was always in there anyway.  I’ll never know.  I do know that when I got physically sick, I got mentally sick as well.  And I was unprepared.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve spent most of today in bed thinking about the phrase “it gets better” and the campaigns and social movements surrounding it.  Most of these are aimed at depressed and suicidal individuals with the thought process that if only we believe hard enough for long enough, all of our problems will eventually get better.  Through hard work or divine intervention, it will get better.  Here’s the problem with that slogan.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>True or not, clinically depressed individuals cannot comprehend that statement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That campaign stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what depression actually is.  It works for moody teenagers and temporarily suicidal college students, because, for them, it truly will get better.  Failing a final will not ruin your entire life.  Breaking up with a partner hurts, but the resulting depression is temporary and will heal with the pain.  For a lot of people, it will get better if they wait long enough or try hard enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Someone with clinical depression suffers from a break down within the brain.  Certain nerves and glands misfire, certain hormones are not exchanged properly, or certain receptors just don’t work.  There’s a lot of science behind it, and honestly they don’t really understand it completely.  That’s why mental health patients often have to cycle through drugs and dosages before landing on the ones that work for them.  The short of it is depression is a physical failing that creates an uncontrollable mental and emotional imbalance.  And, often, it does not get better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Take mine for example.  A possibly preexisting imbalance that was triggered or worsened by the onset of a chronic physical illness.  I’ve had two psychologists confirm this is not just the moody blues.  I have developed full-blown clinical depression.  And, not matter how hard I pray or how many drugs I take, it will not go away.  Our current medical approach to depression is incurable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It will not get better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not only will it not get better, people telling me it will actually makes it worse.  It gets better means I didn’t try hard enough.  It gets better puts the fault on me.  It means that today, when I was unable to force myself to get out of bed, I was just being lazy.  I was the one who didn’t try hard enough.  I didn’t have the gumption to feed or dress myself.  I didn’t want to be ok bad enough.  That’s what you tell a clinically depressed person when you say “it gets better”.  That’s not what you meant?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It doesn’t matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Talking to a depressed person about the future is the greatest exercise in futility I have ever witnessed.  I don’t remember the past days when I was happy and care-free.  I know they existed.  I have pictures.  But I don’t remember those emotions.  Similarly, I can’t see a future in which I am happy again.  I don’t know how to feel that emotion anymore.  I can’t even visualize it right now as I’m writing about it.  My life is zeroed in on today and right now and how I’m feeling and what I’m doing right that moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And usually, how I’m feeling is numb.  I have spent the last few months of my life completely at war with my desire to lie in bed and never get up again.  Every morning I wake up and spend about 45 minutes convincing myself it’s worth it.  On days when my stomach is acting up, that time is extended.  And there have been a lot of days of failure.  I’ve missed classes.  I’ve ignored text messages and emails.  I’ve skipped meals.  I’ve spent days basking in the relentless meaninglessness of my own existence, knowing for a fact that nothing I do matters and I will eventually die so why not today.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And your gut reaction will be to tell me this isn’t true.  It’ll get better.  It’s happened already.  Friends telling me they love me and they’re here for me and they’ll talk when I need to.  Here’s the problem.  In those moments, I don’t want to talk to you.  Anything you say to me is meaningless.  Your love is meaningless.  Your love can even be harmful.  I am such a basket of pain and numbness and anxiey that your attempt to intervene can throw me out of a very delicate balance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Medications calm the chaos.  Medications allow me to get out of bed more days than I normally could.  But they don’t cure that feeling.  They make it all a little fuzzier and distant.  Numb in a good way.  It’s an angry numbness though.  It’s buzzing and itching.  It’s a skin that doesn’t exactly fit.  It’s screaming fuck you at the car behind you that honks their horn for no reason.  It’s sitting up at night crying without knowing why.  It’s letting your body waste away because it’s easier than dealing with the physical illness that will eventually kill you.  It&#8217;s wondering how long it actually takes to starve to death.  It’s wondering why your significant other loves you enough to watch you go through all this and stick around.  It’s staring at the ceiling wondering how you could possibly tell me I could make my life better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And it becomes manageable, but it certainly doesn’t get better.</p>

<p>Today I am hungry.  Today I am nauseous.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was thinking about it just now, and I’ve never really considered how different my life is now that I’m sick and have been diagnosed.  Obviously, life has changed.  You don’t gain a chronic illness and go back to life as usual unless you are very very lucky.  Illness almost always has a permanent effect on you and your way of life, and you don’t realize it until you get sick.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Which is actually why I’m writing this.  As I said in my previous post, most of my friends consider me cured.  I seem to live a normal life, I seem mentally and physically able bodied, and I seem happy.  I am none of those things.  If you are unfamiliar with the Spoon Theory, now would be a good time to google it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Take today for example.  This morning I woke up extra nauseous.  This morning at precisely 1:34 am.  I know the time because I grabbed my phone on the way to the bathroom, expecting to be in there waiting to vomit for a while.  However, as soon as I got out of bed and walked to my bedroom door, the sensation vanished completely.  I shrugged and got back into bed, spent a little time getting comfortable and started drifting back to sleep.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a completely normal occurrence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most nights, it stops there and I simply sleep for the rest of the night.  Otherwise, what happens next is a series of unfortunate events.  I spent the next few hours of the morning almost falling asleep, waking up to nausea or abdominal cramps, walking to the bathroom door, and going back to bed without ever actually entering the bathroom.  It is now 5:24 am.  I am excessively tired and finally fall asleep until my alarm goes off at 7:00 am.  I have gotten about 4 hours of actual sleep.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a completely normal night.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This series doesn’t happen every night, or even most nights.  It’s a number somewhere between a third and half.  Not enough for my doctors to consider it a problem, but enough to have entered into my new normal.  You’ll notice I didn’t mention any form of the words “confusion” or “frustration” in that description.  Because on these nights I don’t feel those emotions.  I go into autopilot and walk about my “morning routine” as much as necessary until my body feels like allowing me to sleep, and then I do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I should say here that I don’t ever actually vomit.  Though one of the symptoms of gastroparesis is excessive vomiting, my version doesn’t give me that relief.  I’m told this is normal.  I’m also told the people who spend most of their days vomiting don’t get any relief from the action anyway.  That is to say, vomiting doesn’t make the nausea any better.  At any rate, I don’t actually vomit.  I just go to the bathroom as a safety precaution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, it is now 7:00 am, I have gotten 4ish hours of sleep and I have about an hour and a half to get ready for school.  My first action is to take two pills, one for nausea and one for anxiety.  I then assess the results of the previous night’s activities.  I didn’t sleep enough and am therefore too nauseous to eat breakfast.  This will trigger my anxiety.  If I eat, I will be more nauseous, experience extreme abdominal pains, and later likely have diarrhea.  My morning nausea pill will do almost nothing today.  I have to take it anyway.  It keeps my digestive system stimulated and because of it maybe I will get lunch later.  I get up to make tea, set an alarm for about an hour, and lay back down to rest.  This hour is the one I normally spend eating breakfast, showering, doing makeup, and any other things I do on good days.  Because today is a bad day, I have fewer spoons and need the extra rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now here’s the kicker.  All bad nights result in bad days, but not all bad days are a result of bad nights.  That is to say a third to half of my nights are bad, but a little over half of my days are bad.  I don’t always get the warning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The rest of the day follows a similar pattern.  I go to class and attempt to pay attention despite wanting to fall back asleep in my chair.  At lunch time, I take a second nausea pill and reassess.  I am tired, anxious, still too nauseous to eat, and running out of spoons.  After noon some time, my body realizes I haven’t consumed anything but tea since I woke up and my stomach starts growling.  I am still too nauseous to eat.  I have to let it grumble and move on with the day.  This will trigger my anxiety.  I work on school work.  I don’t get to take a nap.  I take pills for anxiety and depression.  I reassess.  I am very tired, my attention is wandering, my stomach is growling, I am nauseous, and I am out of spoons.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have one class left to attend.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If I attend class tonight I will sit in a chair for an hour and a half daydreaming.  If I don’t attend class, it will be the third time in a row I have missed that class.  Both will trigger my anxiety.  Either way I will be tired, my mind will be wandering, my stomach will be growling, I will be nauseous and anxious, and I will be into tomorrow’s spoons.  I will reassess after class.  I will take my nausea pill.  I will likely still be too nauseous to eat.  My hands will start shaking if they haven’t already.  This will trigger my anxiety.  I will take a bevy of pills for nausea, depression, and anxiety and attempt to sleep.  I will end the day exhausted, mind numb, shaking, anxious, stomach growling, and out of spoons for tomorrow as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And I will be nauseous.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a completely normal day.</p>

<p>As I write this, my hands are shaking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I reentered FaceBook society today after taking a mental health break.  In the wake of our questionable President-Elect, I have been forced to reorganize my though processes concerning the next four years of my life.  It is no secret Mr. Trump is no fan of disabled persons and I have no doubt that extends to people of any kind of mental and physical health problems.  You can’t really expect a person who claims pregnant women are an inconvenience to employers to have any sympathy for those of us with chronic and sometimes debilitating illnesses.  It has already been hard to plan with an unpredictable disease like gastroparesis.  Now I am trying to factor in variables like cuts to public health programs, the loss of the Affordable Care Act, and rising prescription drug prices under a regime that has expressed no interest in curbing them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I saw a post today about a young girl being fitted for leg braces as a result of a disease that will likely take her life in the next 4 years.  The point of the post wasn’t “isn’t my daughter’s life sad” though.  It was “my daughter will need these public health funding programs that Republicans are threatening to cut in the very near future”.  Everyone keeps telling those dependent on such programs to just get out there and vote for a better candidate next election.  As if that were possible.  As if we had the time.  We can’t wait 4 years for a better president.  We need one now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many of my friends have commented on what an improvement my health has made recently.  “You got so skinny for a while.”  “We were so worried about you.”  “I’m so glad you’re better now.”  I have a secret to tell you all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My health will be short-lived.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You see, almost all of my recent gains have come as a result of a drug called Reglan.  If you don’t shudder at the sight of that name, that’s fine.  It’s marketed as a short-term solution to nausea, vomiting, GERD, and is even sometimes given to pregnant women to help with the production of breast milk.  What Reglan does is stimulate the nerves and muscles of the digestive system in order to help you digest food more efficiently and quickly.  A miracle for someone whose stomach doesn’t digest food at all on its own.  Why don’t we hand this out like candy?  Cure sufferers of chronic stomach ailments once and for all?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reglan doesn’t start causing problems until you are taking it long term.  “Long term” here means more than a few weeks.  It starts with increased anxiety and nervousness and escalates into full on Parkinson’s-like tremors and muscle movements.  An irreversible neurological disorder call Tardive Dyskinesia.  Symptoms include tremors and shaking in the extremities, facial twitching and grimacing, random movements of the limbs, and difficulty breathing.  Unmistakably linked to use of neuroleptics, antipsychotics, and drugs like Reglan.  In fact, multiple doctors have told me Reglan has an unusually high chance of producing Tardive Dyskinesia over the long term.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve been on it for over a year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For starters, I didn’t feel like starving to death at the ripe old age of 22.  But also, there exists a percentage of Reglan users with gastroparesis who never develop complications.  I spoke to someone who’s been on it for 8 years without a problem and I spoke to someone who developed symptoms the day she started taking it.  So you don’t really know.  Maybe you win the lottery or maybe this game of Russian Roulette puts a bullet in you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My point in all this is there is a very high probability of me needing to quit my miracle drug in the near future.  If I’m going to develop symptoms, I’m going to do it soon.  I’ve goon too long without side effects.  My doctors are considering taking me off before I develop symptoms to begin with.  For them, the chances of possibly irreversible damage are too high.  I still prefer not to starve to death.  But if you paid attention to my introductory post, you know what happens to me when my stomach isn’t medicated.  If you know me in real life, you got to witness years of it up close.  And my window is closing right as our loving Republican party is threatening to defund and take away the very health programs and insurance policies that will keep me alive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We don’t have 4 years and we don’t have the option of hoping Mr. Trump’s policies overlook us in the coming reign.  We are going to need help and we are going to need it soon.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And, as I write this, my hands are shaking.</p>

It’s marketed as a short-term solution to nausea, vomiting, GERD, and is even sometimes given to pregnant women to help with the production of breast milk.  What Reglan does is stimulate the nerves and muscles of the digestive system in order to help you digest food more efficiently and quickly.  A miracle for someone whose stomach doesn’t digest food at all on its own.  Why don’t we hand this out like candy?  Cure sufferers of chronic stomach ailments once and for all?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reglan doesn’t start causing problems until you are taking it long term.  “Long term” here means more than a few weeks.  It starts with increased anxiety and nervousness and escalates into full on Parkinson’s-like tremors and muscle movements.  An irreversible neurological disorder call Tardive Dyskinesia.  Symptoms include tremors and shaking in the extremities, facial twitching and grimacing, random movements of the limbs, and difficulty breathing.  Unmistakably linked to use of neuroleptics, antipsychotics, and drugs like Reglan.  In fact, multiple doctors have told me Reglan has an unusually high chance of producing Tardive Dyskinesia over the long term.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve been on it for over a year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For starters, I didn’t feel like starving to death at the ripe old age of 22.  But also, there exists a percentage of Reglan users with gastroparesis who never develop complications.  I spoke to someone who’s been on it for 8 years without a problem and I spoke to someone who developed symptoms the day she started taking it.  So you don’t really know.  Maybe you win the lottery or maybe this game of Russian Roulette puts a bullet in you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My point in all this is there is a very high probability of me needing to quit my miracle drug in the near future.  If I’m going to develop symptoms, I’m going to do it soon.  I’ve goon too long without side effects.  My doctors are considering taking me off before I develop symptoms to begin with.  For them, the chances of possibly irreversible damage are too high.  I still prefer not to starve to death.  But if you paid attention to my introductory post, you know what happens to me when my stomach isn’t medicated.  If you know me in real life, you got to witness years of it up close.  And my window is closing right as our loving Republican party is threatening to defund and take away the very health programs and insurance policies that will keep me alive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We don’t have 4 years and we don’t have the option of hoping Mr. Trump’s policies overlook us in the coming reign.  We are going to need help and we are going to need it soon.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And, as I write this, my hands are shaking.</p>

<p>So this is my blog.  I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time thinking about starting one, wondering what I would share, and how I would go about saying it.  Mostly, though, this exists for my sanity, and anything I write will be for the purpose of preserving my sanity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was born on November 9th of a year I will not specify.  For most of my life, I&#8217;ve been fairly normal and healthy.  Maybe I didn&#8217;t get along with everyone, and maybe I suffered some childhood traumas that needed a little therapy to work through, but I was nothing out of the ordinary.  And yes, I consider needing a little therapy at some point ordinary.  I did well in school, got accepted into the accelerated programs at all levels, took some Advanced Placement classes and eventually graduated with a respectable GPA and many college prospects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My problems began so slowly I didn&#8217;t really recognize them at first.  You see, because my parents couldn&#8217;t afford to send me to the schools I wanted to attend (something I will <strong>never</strong> blame them for), I took a year and a half off to "find myself" (essentially do whatever I wanted) before entering my local City College to get my shit together.  It took me a while to figure out my major, and I jumped from Chemistry, to Linguistics, to Foreign Languages, before settling on English Literature.  It made sense when I finally got there.  What do I love more than anything?  Reading and writing.  Why not get a degree in it?  All the while I was watching my friends essentially speed past me, get degrees, get employed, get married, etc. while I kinda&#8230;&#8203; sat.  If you asked me then, I would have said I&#8217;m going at my own pace and fuck you if you have a problem with it.  It was nice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Midway through June of 2013, I woke up nauseous.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looking back, this wasn&#8217;t the start of my anxiety disorder.  It was just the proverbial straw.  The start was that pesky trauma I mentioned, followed by not being able to go to college, followed by watching everyone around my basically live their lives without me.  It all built up into this little ball inside me that I wasn&#8217;t recognizing.  And then I woke up nauseous.  And then I stayed nauseous.  And then my doctor told me I had ulcers.  And then acid reflux.  And then a bacterial infection. And a bowel disorder. And IBS. And allergies. And then&#8230;&#8203; nothing.  I went through 12 doctors, untold tests and procedures, medications galor, side effects, and none of them helped.  I went from 160 pounds to 95 in 6 months.  I lived on rice and potatoes for a year.  They finally found a medication that stabilized me, but nothing made the nausea go away.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I gave up on the doctors and I gave up on my health and I let myself deteriorate and just continued on with school.  I developed serious perfectionism, then paranoia, germaphobia, all of which bloomed into Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depressive episodes.  My life imploded, and I let it.  I began a slow spiral into insanity and all the little things I had ignored about my life came back to haunt me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In May of 2015 I was accepted to The University of California Berkeley.  In August of 2015 I was diagnosed with Gastroparesis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gastroparesis is the weakening or total paralysis of the stomach muscles.  The symptoms are nausea, vomiting, stomach and abdominal pains, constipation, acid reflux, loss of appitite, and weight loss.  It can be caused by diabetes, cancer, botched abdominal surgeries, certain auto-immune disorders, complications of viral infections, and old age.  I had all of those symptoms and none of those causes.  I fall into the 10-15% of cases that present idiopathic.  No known cause.  No cure.  The only treatments are certain medications that can speed the emptying of the stomach, block nausea receptors in the brain, and calm the stomach acid.  And I finally got help.  Not just with my stomach, but with my anxiety and depression.  I found an answer, I found a reason to keep going, and, with the help of my now-fiancé, I found a psychiatrist.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, over a year later, I also have this.  A place to come with my struggles and anxieties.  This is not a happy story with a happy ending unfortunately.  My diagnosis brought more anxiety and stress.  Attending Cal, a top university, multiplied it.  I am in a place where I don&#8217;t know what to do or where to go from here.  There are no more answers to find, just the next treatment and the next day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I guess, while accepting the risk of sounding cheesy, I hope to help others like me.  This battle has encompassed me, body and mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And I am not alone.</p>
