= Self-Love

On January 1st of 2016 I made a New Year’s resolution to take more selfies.  The thought process was that I was slowly drowning in a vat of self-hate and I wanted to start taking steps toward having a more healthy and loving self-image.  I considered baby steps when contemplating this journey, because I knew that turning my view of myself around would take a lot of work.  I knew this because I’d done it before.

When I was a freshman in high school, I had a crush on a boy.  It wasn’t my first crush, and it wouldn’t be my last, but it was the first one in high school.  As it turned out, we had mutual friends who were sympathetic to my cause, who thought we would make a cute couple, who knew that I wouldn’t approach him myself, and who genuinely thought he would return my feelings.  I don’t know exactly how the conversations went, but I found out through him that one or two of our mutual friends had mentioned to him that I was interested in him, and they passed along their own opinions that he should ask me out.  Instead, in the same message that I learned this information, he informed me that he had been interested in me at one point, but something that I had said or done over the course of our interactions had convinced him that I was a raging bitch and he had no interest in even befriending me, much less dating me.  Being the emotionally immature teenager that I was, this devastated me.  Someone who I liked, who I wanted some sort of relationship with, who I didn’t even really interact with outside of classes, thought I was enough of a toxic bitch that he wanted nothing to do with me.  And this wasn’t a case of hearsay, he contacted me himself to tell me this.  

It was probably the first time I sat down and examined myself and the way I acted towards other people.  I had been an angry person through the end of elementary school (about fourth or fifth grade) until the beginning of high school for various reasons, but I had never really considered how this made me appear to people around me.  I even went to my closest friends and asked if they agreed with his assessment, and the responses, though more kindly worded, all rounded out to the same message.  I wasn’t the worst person in the world, but I was a bitch and people didn’t know how to handle me because of it.

Hindsight being 20/20, I was a little hard on myself as a result of all this introspection.  I basically clammed up in class and clubs and only talked to people when they addressed me first, and even then I usually found my words too harsh or sarcastic.  I wasn’t satisfied with any of my interactions with my peers to a point that I began to convince myself that no one actually wanted to be friends with me.

I still struggle with the standards I set for myself during that time.  I’ve come to embrace the parts of my inner bitch that I deem necessary, but I still feel nervous interacting with people I want to be friends with.  I still struggle with anxiety surrounding conversations and interactions I have with my peers.  I constantly wonder if people actually like me or if they secretly think I’m a raging bitch.  But at the same time, I’ve come to understand that I expect honesty from myself and that is sometimes more important that whether or not someone likes me.  The point is that my self-image struggles for many years have surrounded how I express myself, whether or not I express myself the way I intend, and whether or not the way I present myself is authentic without being unnecessarily harsh.

After I became sick, my struggle shifted toward my body-image.  I have said in the past that I had never had body-image issues in the past.  I was never really conventionally attractive or unattractive, I just was.  My body functioned and I was happy with it and comfortable in it.  Since June of 2013, I had slowly begun to view my body as an adversary.  And so at the beginning of 2016, I began to contemplate ways of changing this mindset, knowing my past with self-image issues, and knowing in what ways I struggle with setting boundaries and altering my own thought processes.  

So my first baby step was to take more selfies.  I thought if I had more opportunities to find myself attractive and view my actual body in a positive light, it would help and I didn’t foresee any negative anxieties growing out of it.  And for the most part, I succeeded.  I took more selfies, I liked the way I looked in them, I posted them to the internet, and I hated my body a little less.  

What I didn’t foresee were all the external forces that would arise to continue beating down my self-esteem while I attempted to shore it up with my baby steps.  Admittedly, my plans were not the best laid.  I didn’t really have a step two in mind other than a vague plan to keep my weight in a healthy zone and some daydreams about light exercise to keep me feeling good.  

Those plans vanished when I began to realize I had no idea how to be healthy with gastroparesis.  There are some vague guidelines on the internet about squashes and smoothies, but the consensus seems to be eat whatever will stay down and take vitamins for the rest.  The easiest foods for me seem to be sugary or full of carbs and, therefore, not the best for maintaining weight.  As for exercise, if my experiences in New York were any indication, the best I can do is take short, slow walks, at least until it cools down more outside.  Also not the best circumstances for feeling healthy.

So what inevitably happened was I spent two-ish years regaining weight, back up to my healthy zone, and then I continued to gain weight because I have no idea how to stop other than eating less.  At last check-up, I weighed 180 pounds.  Granted, that’s not too high a number for someone of my height and build, but it’s higher than I wanted to go, and that was a few months ago.  The unforeseen side-effect of this weight gain, and the hit to my self-image, was me slowly becoming unable to fit into any of my clothes.  This wasn’t a problem when I was losing weight because I had hope that I would eventually gain that weight back and be able to fit into those clothes again.  It has become a problem now because there are only two reasons I would begin losing weight again; I begin eating less (an unhealthy option), or I have to stop taking the medication that makes me able to eat at all (a very unhealthy option).  And the process of slowly outgrowing all of my clothes has not been positive for me.

So instead of slowly feeling better about myself, I’ve been slowly spiralling down into depression and self-hate and body hate.  

The reason I’m thinking about all of this is that I have a new therapist who is very crunchy granola, and she began our meetings by attempting to figure out how I can reconnect with my body in a healthy and positive way.  Her suggestions were all yoga and swimming and healthy eating and displayed an expected lack of understanding of my body’s limitations.  It was our first meeting and I don’t expect her to be an expert on gastroparesis.  But it got me thinking back to that optimism I had in January of 2016, and I started wondering about things that I could actually do to make myself feel better about my body.

In my head, I keep going back to eating better and finding a way to exercise.  But at the same time, I don’t feel like expecting my body to change is a positive approach.  It’s taken me a long time to accept that my gastroparesis is likely going to be a lifelong ailment.  I am always going to struggle with this.  But I don’t have to continually struggle with my body-image.  So now it’s time to lay some better plans.  How do I accept my new body with all it’s future changes and challenges?

Unfortunately, I don’t think taking more selfies is going to be an aggressive enough approach.
