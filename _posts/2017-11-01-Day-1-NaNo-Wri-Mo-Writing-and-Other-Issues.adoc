= Day 1 - NaNoWriMo, Writing, and Other Issues
:hp-tags: NaNo2017, Day 1, Writing, Everyday Life, 

So NaNoWriMo.  Also known as National Novel Writing Month, NaNo is a challenge accepted by writers and aspiring authors every year to write 50,000 words solely within the month of November.  If you do it, you “win” and gain bragging rights and a bumper sticker or something.  I’m not really sure.  Your icon on the NaNo website gets a little crown over it or something.  I’ve clearly never won, so I don’t actually know what happens.  

Anyway, technically, those words are supposed to be aimed at making a novel or story or narrative of some sort, but I’ve met people who do all kinds of things with their 50,000.  A couple of friends on LiveJournal co-wrote a very entertaining fanfiction a few years ago.  Vampires, Fae, death, fire, all kinds of things.  It was a great story, but novel it was not.  I’m sure if they had taken out the copyrighted material and renamed some of the characters, they could have published it as a novel.  But they chose not to, and the masterpiece exists on LJ to this day unless the Russian mafia have deleted it for the crime of containing gayness.

You know how Russians are nowadays with the gayness.

So anyway, the goal is basically to write something like 1,667 words in a day every day for the thirty days of November, which adds up to 50,010 words on November 30th.  Something vaguely literary is prefered, but the operators of the challenge don’t actually police what you’re writing every day.  For example, instead of writing this post, I could really just sit here and type “blah blah blah” 1,667 times and enter it into their word counter and get my points for the day.  No one but me would know.  I don’t know why someone would do that as you don’t actually win anything, but you could do that.  Instead, I’ve decided to adapt the challenge and write a blog post for each of those days.

I got the idea from a thing YouTuber personalities do called Vlogoween and Vlogmass.  Vlogoween occurs during October, and the goal is to post a video, vlog, or similar channel content every day for the month of October.  Vlogmass is the same idea, just in December.  Some content creators do one or the other depending on which holiday they’re most excited about, some do both, and so do neither.  The only real difference is there’s no word or minute count goal for the creator to hit.  They just need to make some form of content every day for a month.  

We passed 400 words in that paragraph by the way.

So taking the ideas behind Vlogmass and Vlogoween, why can’t I write a blog post everyday?  Well firstly, I’m not sure I want to sit here and write 1,667 words a day.  And just thinking about it right now, there are a few days standing out in my head that I know I won’t be able to write at all, so really I need to do more than 1,667 to make up for those days.  I won’t be able to write on Sunday for example, unless I take my ipad on a Postmates journey and dictate a blog post to it full of the expletives I yell at my fellow drivers and pleasantries exchanged with customers.  I also probably won’t be able to write on Thanksgiving, because, you know, family stuff will be happening.  

So there’s 3,334 words right there that I’m going to have to make up for during the other twenty eight days of the month that I’m writing.  If I write.  As we have examined in this blog, I also suffer from mental illness and gastroparesis, and some days I’m not going to want to write.  I’m going to want to jump off a cliff, or sit in my car and cry, or lay in bed and nap.  Who’s writing my 1,667 words those days?  

The other conundrum I face is examining the reason I write to begin with.  If I’m not writing for a novel, why am I writing 50,010 words in November?  I suppose I can make this blog into a sort of personal novel.  I can tell stories from my past, I can talk about my day, I can get up close and personal on some issues I have issues with.  But that wouldn’t make a novel.  Really, if anything, this experiment is going to be a random series of rambling blabberings I come up with every day out of the desperation of needing to string many words together in a short amount of time.  If the experiment happens at all.

I am sick after all and I don’t know how long I’m going to be sick.  Sitting at my computer all day writing is bad for colds.  Also, Writing is hard.  Take a moment to stare in awe at the understatement of that sentence.  “Writing is hard,” says the English major.  And yet, I used to write for fun.  I used to for shits and giggles and fanfiction string together my words and publish them unto the internet and sometimes people would even read them and some of those people even enjoyed them.  Writing used to be fun.  Hard, yes.  But very fun.  Stress relieving.  I used to throw multiple pages down in a night because I realized I hadn’t updated my current story in a while and I felt bad for the people who were reading and waiting for updates.

The difference between me and the YouTube peoples who celebrate Vlogmass and Vlogoween is that they aren’t completely burned out on their chosen medium.  They love vlogging and content creating and they love it so much they fling themselves into these challenges to do it every day for a month for no reward whatsoever.  I look at that type of time commitment and thought process and I question myself.  Do I want to write that much all day every day for a month?  And at the same time, if I don’t what business do I have calling myself a writer at all?  I’m sitting here applying for jobs that would require such writing from me for much longer than a month.  More writing even.  I’m sure the average technical writer or copywriter gets in more than 1,667 words in an eight hour day.

We’re up to 1071 words by the way.

So the question becomes am I still a writer?  Do I still love to write?  Do I still even want to write?  And in order to answer that question, I have decided to perhaps undertake this challenge.  To write 50,010 words in one month.  Surely an aspiring novelist, copywriter, editor, whatever can achieve such a feat.  If not, maybe writing isn’t for me after all.  

Or maybe I go back to the shadowy corners of the internet with my writing and write bad gay porn about my favorite fiction characters.  Because at the end of the day, that’s what started me writing in the first place.  A terribly written story about Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley in a passionate love affair behind the backs of all of her brothers, written when I was about twelve, had no idea what love even was, and hadn’t read the sixth book yet.  In my defense, it wasn’t out yet.

But twelve year old me had a passion for what she did in the darkness of her room where no one but she and her characters dared tread.  She had a laptop and a dream, a hero to look up to, a life to look forward to.  Did I break her along the way?  I’m not sure she exists anymore in the smoky ruins of my memory.  I can’t call her up anymore, I can’t tap into her love affair with the written word.  But I see her in my mind’s eye anyway, hunched over a keyboard as I am right now.  Smaller, happier, and less afraid, and oh so passionate.

Where did her passion go and can I reclaim it?  

Part of this challenge is discovering myself as I am now.  Do I want to write for a living?  Do I even want to write anymore?  What it just a passing phase I went through at the loneliest time in my life, when no one would hear me but thousands read my words with fervour and anger and love and tears?  I inspired those emotions once.  

1423 words now.

I wonder some days if I’m walking down the wrong path, and I guess now is the time to figure out if I am or not.  I can take a break from applying for writing jobs and look to other outlets.  I have other skills.  And sometimes you just need to pay the bills and worry about passion and meaning later.  Maybe my shadowy love affair with the English language should remain in the shadows.  We can visit for a time and make beautiful moments and free them into the void as if we gave a damn and maybe someday someone will see us and smile or grimace or cry or laugh.

So this month is the month I decide if I am a writer for now until the next time I question my existence.  I face down NaNoWriMo with all the adjectives in the world in my heart and maybe I can find that little twelve year old girl in me again.  Because she would have looked at this challenge and laughed in its face and proclaimed her poetry from the mountaintops and the cliffs of the beach and the seagulls would laugh at her and the runners passing by would wonder why there was a strange child screaming at the ocean, but to her it would be a fortress and a quest and a laughable challenge.

And at the end of it she would go about her day with the smug knowledge that she was a writer through and through.  She would have slain Harry Potter himself for the joy of it and the sorrow because she knew he would be back the next day to fight fire with fire.

And that’s really all I want at the end of the day.

I just

Want

To know...

So Day 1.  

That was three words right there.  Look at how good I am at this.
