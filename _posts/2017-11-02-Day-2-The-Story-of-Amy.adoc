Today I’m going to tell you a story.  It is a story I haven’t told many people.  Some of you were there for some of it, one of you was there for all of it, some of you have probably put together the pieces from things I’ve said in the past.  It is not the whole story, but it is a large portion of it.  And I will tell it to you without any expectation of forgiveness, understanding, or sympathy for the things I have done and the things I have yet to do.

Today I will tell you the story of Amy.

Imagine, if you will, a young child.  4 years old.  She is tall and skinny for her age, blessed with hair blonde as the sun is yellow and wild as the wind, eyes as blue as the sky, and a bright red birthmark splashed across the left side of her face.  The mark will shrink with age, the hair will darken, and the eyes will dim, but for now picture her as she was 20 years ago.  

Remember her with a smile across her face, baby teeth still firmly in place, skipping across the street to her first day of kindergarten holding her mother’s hand.  Her navy blue jumper falls to her knees, covered in white tights, and buckles around the collar of her white blouse.  Her wildly curly hair is pulled into pigtails as Amy never had the patience to sit still long enough for her mother to do much more with it.  They will be gone by the end of the day, not because Amy doesn’t like them, but because she can’t help losing her hair things.  This is her favorite outfit.  She went to many stores with her mother looking for the perfect navy blue dress to wear with the perfect white blouse to her first day of school.  Her mother probably smiles as she walks alongside her skipping daughter, dressed in her best office dress as she goes to work after Amy passes through the gates of the school.  On mom’s other side walks Amy’s older brother, wispy as smoke in my memory because he is 4 year older and was not in focus on this day.  This day was for the sun and the trees lining the school’s block and the cars pulling up to drop off children and the other kindergartners playing in their own fenced off playground.  It is for Amy’s white shoes flashing in the sun as she skipped, and for the hem of her dress swinging estatically, and for the pencil box and crayons jingling happily in Amy’s backpack.

She is starting school a year before she is supposed to, at age 4, because her parents signed some special paperwork saying she is prepared and waiving rights to complain if she falls behind due to her age.  Her birthday is in November, three months into the school year, and waiting another year for three months was unbearable to her.  She already knows her letters and numbers after all, and she reads books to her mother and young brother at night at bedtime, and she watches the kids gather in the schoolyard and wonders what they are learning there and she asks and asks her mom when it would be her turn, and this year it is.

There is a famous family story about this Amy.  She sits at the dining room table with her How to Form Letters book and her favorite storytime book open next to it.  She is going back and forth between them and a piece of paper in front of her, carefully forming letters into words into a story about a fox who becomes friends with a dog.  But Amy doesn’t know the niceties of storytelling this young, and her story contains no drama or sadness.  There is sunshine and friendship and the fox and the dog remain friends for as long as they both live.  And Amy has become a writer.

Kindergarten passes as it does for any young child and Amy doesn’t begin to understand life until she enters the rest of the school.  Her kindergarten classes were in their own separate yard and building, and the younger children didn’t interact with the rest of the school.  Amy’s first interaction with the real world occurs when she is five years old and she is walking back to her classroom after recess.  Some older children spot her and begin pointing and laughing.  She doesn’t understand why, and stops walking to stare at them in confusion.

“Did you make your daddy mad or something?”  One of them finally asks.  She shakes her head in confusion.  Her daddy loves her, he never gets mad at her.  “So, what’s with your face, freak?”  She doesn’t understand the question and walks away while they point and laugh some more.  Their words echo in her head until she asks her mother about it at dinner.  The boys at school were mean today.  Was there something wrong with her face?  Her mother explains that some people don’t like it when others look different.

This explanation does little to prepare Amy for the truth of the matter.  As first grade progresses, more and more kids notice Amy, and they notice Amy’s face.  At first they ask strange questions and say mean things, and then they begin to band together to snicker and laugh when she walks by, and then they push her down and run away laughing before the teachers can see them.  And everyday Amy goes home and cries and everyday her mother tells her people don’t like it when you are different and by age six Amy understands that she is different and different isn’t a good thing to be.

As elementary school progresses, the comments and the laughter and the hurt continues.  First Amy is a freak with a red mark and she has big ears.  Then the words get inside and she becomes emotional, so she is a cry baby.  Then a teacher asks why she isn’t playing with the other kids at recess and she tells her, and she is a tattle-tale.  Then she finally makes a friend, but the damage is done, and this friendship proves Amy is a freak because no one else likes her.  Then her friend begins telling the other kids things about Amy, and they have more to make fun of her for.  And this is Amy’s first introduction to betrayal, and she is seven years old, and her friend is laughing with everyone else because she has a mark on her face and big ears and she doesn’t wash her hair every day and she’s too smart and she’s too tall and she’s such a freak.  Her mother tells her to ignore them to make them go away and Amy lays on her bed with her books and cries when she gets home and no amount of ignoring them makes them stop.  The little blonde girl with pigtails and tights becomes a quiet fifth grader who spends all her time in the library.

And one day, as a group of kids pass by the library and snicker and point at her, something very small and fragile, something that’s been worn and worn by all the passing glances and the comments and the pushing and the laughter, something inside Amy’s ten year old heart breaks.  And instead of reading her book and crying, Amy turns and screams at them.  The first time it is just an inhuman noise of rage and pain that sends the laughing faces running.  Then she transforms her pain into words of her own.  She has spent years reading her books and listening to their insults and hearing their gossip and she knows now what hurts people in their hearts and she uses it all.  Because behind her quietly crying exterior, Amy was smart.  She was smarter than most of them, too smart for her own good, a good listener, a good learner, well-read, well-versed in pain, and truly tired of it all.

Amy entered into middle school, sixth grade, burning with rage and hurt and many of her tormentors came with her and started anew, thinking they would continue on tormenting her in this new school with new people to help.  But that fragile thing deep down in her had broken and she was ready for them when they came for her.  The first girl came alone and went away in tears.  Amy knew too many of her weaknesses and they weren’t used to her putting up a fight.  The next attempts went down as the first.  They asked if her face changed colors with the seasons and she asked if their parents’ divorce had gone through yet.  

The problem always was that Amy was too smart.  She was quiet in class while students gossiped freely about who had a crush on who.  She knew which classmates were vulnerable, she knew who was cutting, she knew who was afraid of the dark, she knew who was in the closet, who was failing math.  She knew too much and they never knew how.  But every time they came for her she came back harder.  She began to take pleasure in sending her tormentors away in tears.  She knew what to say when.  She began seeking them out when they finally left her alone.  She crafted her barbs carefully, delivered them spitefully, and took pleasure in the aftermath.  The entire class eventually learned to leave her well enough alone.

She was so smart, and at the same time she was so very blind.  And so very broken.  

Ninth grade saw a new school and mostly new classmates, but Amy’s reputation followed her.  She was a freak still, with a red stain across her face, and a bitch with a taste for blood.  Her only redeeming qualities were that she never harmed where harm had not first been done, and she never harmed physically.  But she would tell you herself that the worst damage was done with words.  Bruises fade, words take root.

All this time Amy continued to read and write and create.  She picked up books her classmates would never see and drank their lessons like water.  She honed her skills, she lived on pain, she picked her battles, and the students at this new school soon learned she had bite.  At the same time, life was going on around her.  She was growing older, hormones were going to work, and she was becoming a teenager.  And she was becoming lonely.  She had built herself a tower, given very few people the key, and then realized what keeps others locked out also keeps her locked in.  And as her reputation spread, very few people came knocking.  So very quick when it came to pain, but so very slow when it came to friendship.  

And so very lonely.

She crumbled inward in the way a building collapses without the proper supports.  She looked at her handiwork and her bloodshed and she wondered at what she had turned into.  She wondered if there was time to change and she wondered if there was anything worth saving even if she did.  She became truly quiet then.  Spoke softly when spoken to, lashed out when pushed, berated herself later, crumbled inward, and the cycle started again.  She didn’t know how to interact with her peers and even if she learned, it didn’t seem like they wanted to interact with her.  She began to think about ending it all then, at the ripe and horrible age of fourteen.

I remember her pain vividly, and I remember her thoughts and reasons.  I remember hot tears running down her face and days at school spent in a blur of sound and color and no emotion.  It was a different pain.  It was a different yearning.  It was a life lived in sorrow and rage and pain, and it was time for it to stop.  

But someone wouldn’t let her stop it.

And so she instead began to change.

I can’t tell you the end of Amy’s story, because it continues on.  But I can tell you the story of Amy; small and blonde, enthusiastic and happy.  She existed once and now she is gone.  She is a shadowy memory in the back of my mind, joyful and kind.  She represents the best of me, and she became the worst.

Here lies Amy, beaten by the ways of the world and her own frail heart.
