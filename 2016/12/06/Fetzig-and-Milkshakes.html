      <div class="paragraph">
<p>A lot of my life revolves around my anxiety, and a lot of people don’t really understand what that means.  If you’ve never experienced an anxiety disorder, you don’t know what that means.  There’s a difference between stress and anxiety, and there’s a difference between momentary anxiety and the type a disorder causes.  That’s not to say one person’s anxiety is more or less valid than another’s.  They’re just different.  The daily anxiety I experience is different than the anxiety you experience when you failed to study for a test, which is different than the stress you feel while doing your math homework.  It’s possible to feel all of these types of anxiety at once and it’s possible to feel only one.  I’m just saying a lot of people don’t understand what a medically diagnosed anxiety disorder entails.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I named this blog, I didn’t just pull Fetzig out of thin air.  I named my anxiety a little over a year ago during a conversation with my fiancée.  I named her, I created a personality for her, and I set her aside in her own place in my mind.  It was important at that time for me to realize that Fetzig is a different entity entirely.  She is a part of me, but she is not me.  I had to figure out a way to keep her from defining my life.  Naming her and giving her a space to sit was how I dealt with the situation, and it’s been fairly successful so far.  I think of my daily anxiety as Fetzig, the overprotective, jumpy, nagging roommate who cosigned the lease on my brain.  And living with her isn’t easy, but it’s easier than having the official words General Anxiety Disorder looming over my life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I call Fetzig overprotective because she gets upset about things that she perceives to be threats to my physical and mental health.  I say she perceives the threats because these are things that I, the sane part of my psyche, know aren’t actually dangerous.  Things like soda and milkshake machines.  There are a lot of those articles going around the internet titled things like “Foods You Should Never Order at Fast Food Restaurants”.  They’re usually lists or click-bait pages that have originated from Redit threads where people talk about all the horrible things they’ve witnessed wherever they were working or eating.  Something that is always on those lists are soda dispensers and milkshake makers, because they can have horrible bacterial growths if not cleaned properly.  If you listen to the internet, and Fetzig, no one ever cleans those machines and you should never drink anything that comes out of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem with articles like that, other than them being extremely inaccruate, is that Fetzig latches onto them and never lets go.  And the problem with labeling milkshakes as dangerous is, believe it or not, they are on every diet list I’ve ever seen for Gastroparesis.  In moderation, they’re a really good source of easy to digest calories and calcium for someone with stomach problems if you can handle dairy.  Depending on what kind of stomach day I’m having, a milkshake is sometimes all I can manage for dinner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was a night about a month ago that I walked out of class, got into my car, and started contemplating what I would have for dinner as I drove home from school.  I was craving something substantive, but my stomach had been acting up that day so I didn’t want to eat anything too big or hard to digest.  I decided a milkshake and some fries from Jack in the Box would be the best thing for the conditions and rerouted to the nearest restaurant to grab dinner before I went to the house.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the way there, I started hearing Fetzig’s voice in my head.  What about that article you read the other day?  That guy said he worked at a popular fast food chain and they never cleaned their shake machine.  What if this Jack in the Box is the same?  You’re going to get sick.  You shouldn’t get the shake.  It’s not safe.  You shouldn&#8217;t even eat here.  How often do they change their fry oil?  You&#8217;ll never know.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I pulled into the parking lot arguing reason with myself.  I even got my Skoddie in on the matter.  I parked and started texting her while trying to convince myself that of course they clean their machines because health code restrictions.  Before long, Skoddie is trying to talk me out of a full blown anxiety attack via text in a Jack in the Box parking lot.  I don’t know if she remembered that conversation we had a year ago, but she was attempting to reason with Fetzig whether or not she realized it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I sat in my car for a good 15 minutes before Skoddie suggested I go looking for the restaurant’s health code certifications.  Where I’m from in Southern California, those ratings are prominently displayed as large colored letter grades in the windows of the eatery in question.  So, thinking this will surely calm my mind, I start walking around this little fast food place looking for something similar.  Seeing nothing on the outside windows, I spend a little time peering into the place looking for a grade posted inside.  No such luck, I return to my car with Fetzig in my brain triumphantly shouting.  See, there’s no certification grade.  This must not be a good place to eat.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’m in my car ready to never eat out again when Skoddie points out that grading system is regional.  In Berkeley, it might be different.  So once again, determined to prove to Fetzig that my milkshake is going to be drinkable, I go back to the windows and start looking for any kind of official looking documentation.  I don’t even think about going inside to ask.  Hello underpaid cashier, please humor my insanity by proving to me you and your coworkers comply with health codes and keep your milkshake machines cleaned properly.  No way.  Instead, I spend ten minutes peering through the windows like a weirdo until I finally spot some official looking documents posted next to the cash registers.  These turn out to be the proof of inspection papers I was seeking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As strange as it sounds, this wasn’t the end of Fetzig for the night.  I spend a few more minutes texting with Skoddie before I feel comfortable enough going through the drive-thru and ordering my dinner.  And even as I’m drinking my milkshake, I hear Fetzig’s voice in my head numbering all the symptoms of food poisoning.  And oddly similar list to my usual Gastroparesis symptoms.  I didn’t end up developing food poisoning, but even that wasn’t the end of Fetzig’s opinion on the matter.  Every time I return to that place to get a milkshake, she’s in my head telling me about that article we read and all the bad things that grow in sugary environments.  I heard her tonight when I went there for a milkshake and fries again.  She was easier to ignore today, but I still heard her.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But it’s hard to view Fetzig as a harmful part of my psyche.  Like I said, she’s just being way over protective.  Maybe someday she’ll keep me from actually getting sick.  I’m not sure she’s been useful in that regard so far, but I’ll never actually know.  She’s the voice that makes me wash the tops of my cans of soup before I open them even though the Mythbusters proved that myth highly unlikely.  Her voice is the one that made me afraid of caffeinated green tea for almost a year, and she continues to keep me from trying sushi even though all sources point to it being really good for you and easy to digest.  She’s the over-active conspiracy theorist living in a corner of my brain.  Her voice is really loud some days and a whisper others.  She’s really easy to ignore some days and harder to overcome others.  But her voice is always there.  She is always there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That is what it’s like living with an anxiety disorder.</p>
