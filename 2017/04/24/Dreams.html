      <div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve always had a strange connection with my dreams.  Until very recently, I dreamed exclusively in nightmares.  At the same time, I almost never remember my dreams.  I knew they were nightmares because I woke up terrified, shaking, and sometimes too scared to look out from my covers to examine my room for a physical manifestation of whatever had just invaded my subconscious.  I was easily scared as a child, and because I didn’t remember my dreams, I never knew what was coming to get me.  I usually remembered a rush of noise, flashes of brightly lit and somehow unsettling colors, but nothing concrete.  Therefore, any misshapen shadow or unexplained noise could be perceived as something unknown creeping out of my nightmares into the living world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Those are the first type of dreams I had and I still have them today and still consider them nightmares.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second type of nightmare is the recurring ones.  These ones are everything the abstract nightmares aren’t.  They are clear, the danger is easily identifiable, and when I wake up I remember them vividly.  The difference is these ones are about things I’m actually afraid of in the living world, and so I don’t wake up terrified because they can’t get into my room.  They aren’t the unknown, they aren’t illogical and hard to describe.  In fact, according to most people, they aren’t even nightmare worthy.  I’ll eventually describe a couple to you and you can decide if that last bit is true or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve also always believed these recurring nightmares serve a purpose.  They aren’t always the exact same dream, but they’re variations on the original, and they happen at particular times in my life.  Like I said earlier, I feel weird about my dreams.  The abstract, immaterial ones scare the crap out of me, but I always eventually fall back asleep and they don’t affect me the next day at all.  The recurring ones wake me up and keep me awake thinking about them.  They affect my mindset about certain things, and they’ve even caused me to make life-altering decisions.  So they are important to me and when I have them I take them seriously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the same time, I don’t believe in the mystical version of dream reading.  I don’t believe my dreams will tell my fortune or hold mystical truths about myself.  At the same time, my recurring nightmares are not “just dreams”.  They’re truths of a certain variety, maybe just in a form my mind can understand better when I’m sleeping.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most popular recurring nightmare is something I call “The Tsunami Dream”.  I call it most popular because it happens the most often of all my recurring dreams.  In its original form, I’m standing on a beach, sometimes alone and sometimes with other people.  The first time I had it the beach was a familiar one, but it isn’t always.  In all versions of the dream, there is a beach and a cliff lining it.  This type of beach occurs in my hometown, but they’re common enough other places that you might know what I’m talking about.  Basically, there’s ocean, then sand, then a cliff, then the rest of the city or whatever.  That part is fuzzy in my dream because I never get there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, I’m standing on a beach and there’s a cliff at my back and the ocean in front of me.  And in the ocean, coming towards me, is one of those towering movie tsunamis than don’t actually occur many places in real life and certainly don’t occur where I live.  You know those giant walls of water that defy gravity and ocean physics and every other law of the land?  It’s always one of those.  And there’s always a choice I have to make before the tsunami reaches me, and I can never make the choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first time I had the dream I was fairly young, and the choice was do I gather my towel and stuff before I run away or not.  I remember this iteration of the dream vividly because I woke up feeling really stupid for having dreamed it.  But in the nightmare, I picked up, dropped, and picked up my towel several times in terrifying indecision before looking up to find the wave crashing over me.  And then I woke up.  I never have to dream through the aftermath of being swept away in a tsunami, but I always feel the crushing realization that I have waited too long to make my decision and there is no getting away from the wave now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you may have guessed, the tsunami dream always occurs when I’m feeling overwhelmed in life, and the decision corresponds terrifyingly with whatever is overwhelming me.  For example, when I first became sick with gastrparesis, before I was diagnosed, I babysat frequently for multiple families.  I love kids and I especially loved the kids I was sitting for at that time.  As I got sicker, I started falling behind the kids in energy and patience and became unable to continue sitting for most of my kids.  There was one family that I wouldn’t let go of though, because the boy had special needs and his sister was amazing and they entire family treated me like I was part of the family.  But I kept getting sicker and sicker without a diagnosis and the boy was quickly becoming too much for me to handle physically.  So, without warning, the tsunami dream resolved the situation by placing me on that familiar beach and placed the boy and his sister at opposite ends of the beach.  Which one do I save before the tsunami kills us all?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As usual, I couldn’t make that decision.  I woke up from that dream crying and quit babysitting for good the next day.  Not because I ever thought I would have to make that decision, but because I realized I wasn’t doing either of those children any good continuing to babysit them in the condition I was in.  In fact, I’m not going to be able to do any children any good in with the disease I have.  And even though I didn’t know at the time that I had a lifelong ailment, I knew I had to stop trying to help my kids until I figured out how to help myself.  And I didn’t have that thought until the tsunami dream made me face the facts about the situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All that example is to say, I have a new recurring nightmare to contemplate and I haven’t figured out what it’s trying to affect.  I started having it when I moved away to Berkeley and it kind of pops up at random.  I had it last night, which is why I’m thinking about it today.  I’ve decided to call it “The Hallway Dream”.  In this dream, predictably, I’m always wandering through a series of hallways.  In the dream, I recognize the hallways as part of my childhood home.  They aren’t, and are never the same from dream to dream, but in the dream I am home.  But there’s something wrong, and dream me can never figure out what it is.  It’s like that scary movie tactic where they slightly skew the camera to unsettle the viewer without the viewer noticing.  The hallways aren’t skewed, but my dream self is slightly unsettled by something she’s seeing in the, to her, familiar hallways.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This nightmare is a weird one to me, because it’s not actually scary.  Thinking about it now, I’m just wandering some seemingly normal hallways.  There are doors, there are pictures and other things hung on the walls, and there’s light enough to see clearly.  But you notice I still call it a nightmare, because I am scared in the dream.  There’s something wrong and my dream persona doesn’t know what it is.  And because I haven’t figured what triggers this dream, I can’t really figure what’s wrong when I’m awake either.  I had it three or four times while I was in Berkeley, I had it once when I was living with my parents after I graduated, and now I’ve had it twice since living with Skoddie.  And I think I’ll continue having it until I figure out what it means.</p>
