      <div class="paragraph">
<p>When I was in seventh grade, about age 12, I asked my mom if I could dye my hair.  I don’t remember where the desire came from, nor why I chose pink as my first color.  I hated the color pink and I had always been told I should love my “beautiful long blonde” hair.  But for some reason I wanted to experiment and for some reason my mom agreed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We called my uncle, who I used to describe as a hair artist because “stylist” never really seemed to accurately describe what he did to my hair when he cut and styled it, and asked for his advice.  We went to the store and found the semi-permanent dye he had recommended, picked the color I wanted, and then brought it to him so he could show my mom how to properly dye hair.  After this, my mom was the one who always re-dyed my hair when it faded, even when I switched colors and experimented with bleaching and moved on to permanent colors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No one ever really cared what I did with my hair, except for the oldest and most stuffy members of my family, and I continued dying it through college until I started shaving it.  If anyone asked how I got my parents to agree I shrugged and said my mom was always for it.  And if anyone asked my mom why she allowed me to do such things to my hair she also shrugged and said it’ll always grow back blonde.  And so I spent most of my life with varying shades of hair and the only times anyone ever noticed was when it completely changed color and then everyone realized Amy isn’t actually a natural readhead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was a point a couple years ago that I decided my long hair was too much damn work.  It was almost down to my butt at the time, dyed a lovely burgundy brown, and carefully layered to allow for its natural curls to flourish.  I won’t lie and say I hated it.  I loved it.  I was long and curly and beautiful after all, and all I had to do was comb it and upkeep the color and it looked fine.  But at the same time, I was very sick.  This was after my Gastroparesis symptoms had started but before I had been diagnosed, and I was more concerned about my free falling weight than I was about keeping up my hair.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I cut it off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I spent a few days looking at it and tugging on it and swishing it this way and that and then I went to a hair salon, as my uncle the artist has since passed away, and had the stylist there give me a lovely short bob.  She was unsure I was serious at first, but I eventually convinced her I was in fact serious and so she cut it off and put it in their donation pile and since then I have had short hair.  And I went through a couple years of waffling and different styles and had a mohawk at one point and an undercut and all those fun things and then I graduated college and spent a few days starting at my hair again and tugging it and swishing it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then I shaved it off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I never vocalized why I ultimately decided to shave it, and the thought process is a bit jumbled, but here it is.  I had been sick for 4 and a bit years at that point, and I’d been contemplating the term “invisible illness” in that time and how it pertained to me and my Gastroparesis, my depression, and my anxiety.  I spent that time looking at myself in the mirror and it kind of hit me that if you didn’t know there was something wrong with me, you’d never know.  I was deeply depressed, I was angry at life and God, I was angry at the healthy people walking down the street, and I was angry at my past self for taking my continued health for granted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are myths and stories history teachers tell of women back in the middle ages and the dark ages.  They would grow their hair long as a signe of womanly beauty and health and when there was illness in the house, they would cut it off as a signal to the rest of the world to stay away.  Depending on who you talk to, the act might have been shameful or frowned upon, even going so far as to hang women by their hair or cut it off as punishment.  It was a visibile sign that the woman was not like every other woman around her.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I wanted my pain to be that visible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s a selfish thought process, I know.  But I wanted it.  I wanted people looking at me to know that there was something wrong with me.  I was, and am, so tired of explaining to people that I am ill.  Incurably.  I was tired of people focusing on my outward appearance of normalcy.  And the thing I kept thinking, fueled by the combination of myths of sick women in the middle ages cutting off their hair and toxic misogyny culture saying “normal” women grow their hair out, was that my hair had already been a battlefield in the past, so why should it be now?  I cut it all off and I immediately felt better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is my declaration to the world in a way.  Look at me, there is something wrong with me.  I am ill.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem now is that people take a woman shaving her head the wrong way.  My plan was too involved and not knowing the thought process behind it meant no one knew why I did it.  I’ve had strangers call me a dyke, I’ve had family members tell me I don’t look right, and I’ve had friends tell me no one is ever going to look at me the same again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See, the problem is that people think I cut all my hair off to be a rocker chick or to be rebellious or similar thought processes.  And in a certain way, rebellion was the impetus, but not in the way most people think.  I’m not trying to rebel against the patriarchy or look less feminine or make a statement about feminine beauty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My illness is invisible and I wanted to make it visible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am rebelling against my depression.  I am rebelling against my Gastroparesis.  I am rebelling against anxiety and paranoia and fear.  I’m doing it in a way that signals to society that there is something wrong with me.  But so many people either don’t know or have forgotten that women used to cut their hair to signal illness that they take “something wrong with me” to mean something else entirely.  To this effect, society has rebelled against me.  People look at me funny, I can’t get a job, I get tipped less on Postmates, and random men including those who should know better tell me men don’t find short hair attractive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But at the same time, I don’t want to grow it back out.  It’s my statement.  It’s my sign post.  There is something wrong with me.  I am sick.  I can’t conform to your standards anymore and I won’t.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is something wrong with me.  You don&#8217;t get to ignore it.</p>
