      <div class="paragraph">
<p>I am tired today. I&#8217;ve been tired for a week. I am bone-achingly, body-numbingly tired.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve been on vacation for the last seven days. I was really excited for this vacation for a number of reasons, the most prevalent of which being I have never been to New York and I was really looking forward to seeing it. My mother-in-law was part of a choir which was invited to perform Kirke Mechem’s <strong>Songs of the Slave</strong> at Carnegie Hall. That was the purpose of our trip, but of course that wasn&#8217;t all that we were going to do while on the east coast and in the great state of New York, where I had never been.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I did go into the trip with a certain amount of trepidation. I can&#8217;t be very active while dealing with my various issues and my stomach can basically revolt at any time it chooses. Leaving the house is hard. Physical activity is hard. Planning ahead is hard. Even walking long distances is hard. I don&#8217;t just have the nausea to deal with. I have low energy, I have abdominal pains, and I have anxiety, germophobia, and depression to take into account. But I was assured my mother in law, who was planning the New York leg of the trip, would take it slow and I had high hopes for the trip.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And for the most part I had a good time. I got to see a lot of sights and shows in New York, we visited Boston where my wife used to live, and I got to try a lot of new things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But along the way I learned that I am disabled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a title I have been very reluctant to claim since my diagnosis. Part of my reluctance is denial, and the hope that I will eventually find a way to do all the things I want to do again.  I had high hopes for my physical health improving and I didn&#8217;t want to claim disability and then renege on that claim later, if I got better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another part of that reluctance is a hesitation to appropriate a title I don&#8217;t deserve. And that reluctance stems from the self doubt anxiety and depression instill in sufferers. I can tell you right now, with my logical mind in gear, that my fears are based in my depression. But this week has proven to me that gastroparesis is a disability. But another part of my brain, the part steeped in anxiety and depression that I have named Fetzig, asks me how I can dare claim that title for myself when there are people who are so much worse off than me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of the day, I was physically capable of doing more than a lot of people with disabilities can do. I walked the streets of New York and Boston without aid of crutches or a wheelchair. I rode the subways of both cities and was only slightly afraid of the germs my immune system was being bombarded with. I even ate food most gastroparesis sufferers daydream about. But I did not do these things without aid, and that, I think, is the important point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of the day, I wasn&#8217;t able to do the things an able-bodied person would have been able to do in my stead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our first full day of sightseeing left me gasping and weak and in pain. I was nauseous, I was aching, and I couldn&#8217;t walk home at the end of the night.  We had visited the 9/11 memorial museum, gone through Wall Street to find the famous Charging Bull and Fearless Girl statues, and seen a Broadway production of “The Book of Mormon”. I couldn&#8217;t finish the museum, we had to leave without walking through all the exhibits. I was stumbling through finding the statues we wanted to see. I was so tired during the play I couldn&#8217;t even bring myself to enjoy what I was watching.  Throughout the day, I was liberally taking my nausea medications to keep my stomach in order.  At the end of the day, my body would no longer respond to my commands. I will treasure all of the memories of that day, but I will be recovering from it for a long time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You see, what happened was my mother in law didn&#8217;t realize I couldn&#8217;t keep that pace. She knows I am sick and she knows I get tired easily, but she didn&#8217;t understand the full scope of the problem. So when she planned a day in New York, she planned like all of the participants would be able to do what any abled person could do. She was confused when I didn&#8217;t want to walk through the entire museum. She was confused when I was tired and hurting after sitting through “The Book of Mormon”. Because an abled person would be able to sit in a nice theatre and watch a play for a couple of hours and feel fine.  But for me it was physically draining.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the first time, I realized that I am not abled. I realized the true meaning of losing spoons and not having the energy to do what I wanted to do, and I realized my body has more limits than I thought it did.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the next day was more of the same, though we attempted to take it at a slower pace. I fpound myself stumbling slowly and painfully through the streets of New York and, at the end of the day, we had to take an Uber home tough the subway was less than a mile&#8217;s walk. And over the course of the week I was less and less able to walk to the subway station, and I was less and less able to handle the heat, and I was more reliant on breaks and Uber and medications and shortcuts. And I&#8217;m sitting on an airplane writing this blog post aching and tired and sick and I feel disabled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am disabled. I have a disability. And I need to stop telling myself that I don&#8217;t deserve that title or that others have it worse.  You don&#8217;t earn a wheelchair or a pair of crutches. You don&#8217;t get a certification card that announces the holder is disabled. No one deserves to be called disabled. It is a condition that some of us have. You don&#8217;t earn it from some sort of disability contest. Who&#8217;s Worse Off? the game show doesn&#8217;t exist. But a week trying to keep up with my physically abled mother in law certainly does.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And maybe if I recognize what my body is telling me and reach for some of those aids others make use of, I can avoid feeling the aching lack of enery I feel today.</p>
