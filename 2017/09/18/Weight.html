    <section class="post tag-Gastroparesis tag-Invisible-Illness tag-Chronic-Illness tag-Body-Positivity">
      <div class="paragraph">
<p>So I’ve spent most of the day staring at an Instagram post from two years ago that showed up in my “On This Day” feed on Facebook.  It’s a picture of me the first time I had a mohawk, from my first few days at Cal, and before I had received any treatment for my Gastroparesis.  I know I hadn’t received treatment yet because another post from that feed shows me talking about how hard I struggled to get a visit with a doctor after I had moved up there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The timeline of my illness around that period is as follows: In May I finally got a referral to and an appointment with a Gastroenterologist.  Also in May, my weight officially hit double digits and my doctor started talking about hospitalization if I continued to lose weight.  Also in May, I was accepted to UC Berkeley.  In June, my Gastro finally ordered the emptying study I had been asking for, and later in the month diagnosed me with Idiopathic Gastroparesis.  In August, I moved to Berkeley, CA to attend university despite the fact that I continued to lose weight.  In September I took many pictures of myself and my firsts at the new school which are now surfacing on Facebook’s “On This Day”.  In October, I weighed in at an even 90 pounds, and a doctor finally put me on medication to control the nausea.  After that point, I was able to eat again, and began slowly regaining the weight I had lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jumping to today, the last time I was in a doctor’s office I weighed in at 185ish pounds.  The result of two years of hard work, medications, therapy, and nausea.  The problem is, I was aiming for 140, and I’ve kinda been giving myself a hard time for over shooting.  I’ve even gone so far as to look up ways to lose weight until I’m back in the range of 140 pounds.  I look at my stomach and thighs in the mirror and hate them, I count my stretch marks and wish they would disappear, I even get frustrated when I try on certain clothes from my “healthier” days and find that they don’t fit me anymore</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve done this without realizing how utterly ridiculous that is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I spent two agonizing years starving and shrinking and dying.  Medications, tests, days lost to side effects and illness and hardships that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy.  And here I am whining because I weigh “too much”, not in a medical sense, but in a personal goals sense.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then those pictures from my first days in Berkeley started coming across my feed again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve been staring at pictures of my arms without an ounce of fat on them, just enough muscle to function and bones distinctly protruding.  I can see my collar bone so defined it presses against the collars of my shirts and creates hollows in my skin where muscle and fat should be.  There are pictures I never shared from the same time period of myself standing in front of a mirror naked with every bone in my body clearly visible through my skin.  I counted my ribs in one of them today and I remembered feeling them through my clothes every time I scratched or wiped something off my shirt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I took those pictures so I would never forget that feeling and that time.  And then I forgot.  I got wrapped up in some weird insecurity complex about my stomach not being flat and my thighs not being thin and I completely forgot how hard I fought for that stomach and those things and those stretch marks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is my reminder to myself.  Those pictures are my reminder.  My body has been punished enough.  It continues to be punished every day by a disease that will never go away.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I need to stop adding to it.</p>
